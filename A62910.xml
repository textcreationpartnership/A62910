            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>I Cannot forget your Grace's Kindneſs and Bounty to me in a Troubleſome time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution from Man, and a Dark-day of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from God; when, by a Diſeaſe, I was brought near the brink of the Grave. In Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, I offer your Grace a Diſcourſe of that <hi>Everlaſting Righteouſneſs</hi> which we have in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of that <hi>Eternal Salvation</hi> we enjoy by him. Some may be wrapt up in the Skirt of Providence, as the Hair in the Skirt of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Garment, <hi>Ezek. 5.3, 4.</hi> for a few years, yet, at laſt, be brought forth, and be caſt into the Eternal Fire of God's Wrath, <hi>2 Theſ. 8, 9.</hi> It will be ſad to have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve for time, and then to feel a dreadful Execution for Eternity; but through the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God may not only, as a Patient Creditor, forbear us for years; but, as a Righteous Judge, juſtify and diſcharge us for ever. <hi>Diogenes Laertius, in vita
<pb facs="tcp:41823:3"/>Socratis,</hi> tells us, That <hi>Apollodorus</hi> brought <hi>Socrates</hi> a Rich Garment to put on, and Die in. I here Preſent to your Grace the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Garment of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> both to Live on, and to Die in. Our blind An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, at a dear rate, purchaſed a Monk's Habit to be Buryed in: but I here tender to your Grace the Beautiful Habit of our Great High-Prieſt, to Adorn and Secure your Soul for Time and Eternity. The builders of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Babel are ſtrangely confounded in their Language; they deny the Imputation of <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs,</hi> yet promiſe their Benefactors that they will Communicate to them the Merits of their Order. Sir <hi>Edwyn Sands,</hi> in his Religion of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> Relates, That he heard a <hi>Capuchin</hi> Preach, and that in his Sermon (as a high act of Charity) he ſaid, <hi>That he would diveſt himſelf of all his Merits, and put them on the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that heard him; but he himſelf would ſtand before God, as the greateſt Sinner of them all.</hi> But what a high ſtrain of Pride is this, to deny the Imputation of <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs,</hi> and yet allow the <hi>Imputation</hi> of their own <hi>Merits</hi> to others, as if Sackcloth could Adorn, but not the Son of Righteouſneſs. <hi>Tucquet,</hi> in his <hi>Spaniſh Hiſtory,</hi> informs us, <q rend="inline">That <hi>Philip the Second,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was (when Sick)
<pb facs="tcp:41823:3"/>directed to take a Crucifix in one hand, and a Candle Conſecrated to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> that is worſhipped at <hi>Monſerat,</hi> in the other hand, and in this poſture to meet Death,</q> the King of Terrors. But is it not infinitely better, that the Lively Picture of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, as drawn in the Goſpel, ſhould be before the eyes of our Minds? and the Son of Righteouſneſs be graſped and held faſt in the Hand of Faith, that Death may be diſarmed of its Sting, and diveſted of its Terror. The Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> is oppoſed by many. <hi>Socinians</hi> deny the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the Price of our Redemption: Others ſeem to over-look the <hi>Active Obedience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it were not the matter of our Righteouſneſs. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt was made under the Law to Redeem us,</hi> Gal. <hi>4.4, 5.</hi> This expreſſion, <hi>made under the Law,</hi> is not to be Reſtrained to <hi>Chriſt's being made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe of the Law,</hi> the Phraſe is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe taken in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Gal. 4.21. You that deſire to be under the Law.</hi> Surely the <hi>Jews</hi> did not deſire to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curſe of the Law, but under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law, as a Covenant. We are poor and weak, as well as guilty Creatures: we need not only that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by enduring the Curſe on the Croſs, ſhould reverſe the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb facs="tcp:41823:4"/>of Death, but alſo, that he ſhould obey the Law, and ſo take it off from us, as a Covenant of Life. If the Sentence of death ſhould be abrogated for the time paſt, and the Law ſtand in force, as a Covenant of Life for the time to come, our State would be hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and deſperate. Some account Faith to be too ſmall and mean a thing for us to be Juſtified by; as <hi>Naaman</hi> thought Waſhing in the Waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> to be too ſlight a Meanes to cure him of his Leproſy, <hi>2 Kings 5.11, 12.</hi> and therefore, by Faith, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all Obedience to the Goſpel, that flowes from it; as when the <hi>Jews</hi> loſt the Spiritual meaning of the Sacrifices, as they did Typifie <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Iſa. <hi>53.10.</hi> they thought the Offering of a Beaſt to be a cheap Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, therefore they would ariſe higher, and <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Firſt-Fruit of their Body for the Sin of their Soul,</hi> Micah <hi>6.7.</hi> So when ſome conſider not, or over-look the Office of Faith, as it is an Inſtrument to receive Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs for Juſtification; they debaſe Faith as a mean thing, and Introduce all New Obedience as the condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. This is to make a Goſpel Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like a Legal Juſtification, wherein Men's own obedience was the Matter of their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and the condition of their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The Wrath of God is Revealed
<pb facs="tcp:41823:4"/>from Heaven againſt us for our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, <hi>Rom. 1.18.</hi> And how might our hearts ſink, if the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God were not Revealed in the Goſpel for our Comfort and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?

                  <p>IN the Fifth Verſe of this Chapter we have a Prophecy and Promiſe of Chriſt; God ſaith, That he would <hi>raiſe up to David a Righteous Branch. David</hi> had too many corrupt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41823:6"/>Children, and degenerate Plants, that did turn off from, and walk contrary to his Piety; but the Lord would raiſe up to <hi>David</hi> a Plant of Renown, a Righteous Branch. Of this Branch it is ſaid, That he ſhould Reign and Proſper; his Dominions ſhould neither have Bounds or End; his Kingdom ſhould neither be kept down, or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down in the World; he ſhould exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgment and Juſtice in the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.4. He ſhould reſcue the Elect from bondage and ſlavery, and break Satan, the great Oppreſſor in Peices; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe that obſtinately adhere to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. He ſhould do God right, and execute his Law by writing it in the Hearts of Men by his Spirit. The Law requires Love to be rendred to God, and our Neighbour; but our fleſh is repugnant to both: Self-Love eats us up, and devours both what is due to God. and what belongs to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: The Law makes its demand, it calls for the Love we owe God and our Fellow-Creature; but is ſtill contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, till Chriſt renews our Nature, and kindles in us both fervent Love
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41823:6"/>to God, and ſincere Love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Even thus the Meſſiah, born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo may be ſaid to be his Younger Brother, raiſes up Seed to him, directs mens Hearts into the Love of God, and inflames their Souls to the Love of their Neighbour. In the words of the Text, we have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promiſe concerning the ſweet Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and bleſſed Fruits of Chriſt's Kingdom. In his Days <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> dwell ſafely. Chriſt's Kingdom is for the ſalvation of men. In <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9. it is ſaid, <hi>Rejoice thou Daughter of Sion, thy King comes:</hi> But in <hi>Iſ.</hi> 62.11. it is ſaid, <hi>Behold thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes.</hi> Chriſt is a ſaving King to enſlaved and periſhing ſinners.</p>
                  <p>In the Text we may obſerve theſe ſeveral parts:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is a great Benefit promiſed, and that is ſalvation; <hi>Judah ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mal. 2.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have the perfection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this ſalvation, <hi>Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely,</hi> Rom. 16.20. Spiritual Enemies ſhall be ſo ſubdued, trodden under foot, and deſtroyed, that they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41823:7"/>ſhall never recover, and lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to enſlave and oppreſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. The uncircumciſed and unclean ſhall no more, as Conquerours, paſs through the Church of God, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 52.1. Her <hi>Walls ſhall be called Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and her Gates Praiſe, Iſ.</hi> 60.18. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and Redeemed Saints may ſerve without Fear, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. They ſhall not be caſt out by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. They ſhall not by Satan, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, be plucked out of Chriſt's hands, <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 28. They ſhall not, by the mutability of their own Wills, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. So they have no ground to dread, that Chriſt will divorce them, that ſin ſhall enſlave them, and that Satan ſhall enſnare and devour them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have the Perſons to whom this Promiſe is made, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:</hi> But doth the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhine only on <hi>Canaan?</hi> Is the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Meſſiah reſtrained to One Nation? No, Chriſt is the Saviour of the World, <hi>John</hi> 4.42. We read of a common Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. and a common Salvation, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 3. <hi>The Hedg is pluckt up, Luke</hi> 14.23. <hi>The Wall of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41823:7"/>Partition is broken down, Eph.</hi> 6.14. The Old Encloſures are thrown open, and Chriſt is God's Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. But why then is <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> mentioned? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They were the Ancient, and for ſome time the only people of God: They were then in being, to receive and embrace the Promiſes. God did know, eſteem, love, deal better with them than with other Nations, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. and the two laſt Verſes. 2. They were as it were, the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of, and the Truſtees for the Church Univerſal; the Oracles of God were committed to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. the Covenant was made with them; the Promiſes of God were given to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. 3. Believers of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are now grafted into this ſtock of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, they are plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Natural Branches; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Olive and its fatneſs, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 17.24. they are Fellow-Heirs of the ſame Body, and Partakers of God's Promiſe in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. and this is both the meaning, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.22. <hi>You ſhall divide the Land by Lot for an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41823:8"/>Inheritance unto you, and the Strangers that ſojourn among you, and that ſhall beget Children among you; and they ſhall be unto you, as born in the Country, among the Children of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>they ſhall have Inheritance with you among the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Canaan</hi> was not only a Type of the Eternal Inheritance, but alſo a Shadow of a Spiritual <hi>Canaan</hi> of the Church of God, and its Priviledges. To ſojourn among the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſeemeth to be the ſame as to be grafted in among the Branches, and to have an Inheritance among the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> may well be expounded by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being made Partakers of the Olive and its Fatneſs; and that Proviſion that is made for the Children that Strangers ſhould beget, that they ſhould have an Inheritance among the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſeemeth to me to point out the Church-Memberſhip of the Children of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that they ſhall be put into the ſame Place, and enjoy the ſame Priviledges that the Children of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had. This ſenſe ſeemeth at leaſt very probable. We never find that material <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and Strangers, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41823:8"/>as this was not practiſed for the time paſt, ſo it ſeems not poſſible or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable for the time to come, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould have a ſhare in ſuch a narrow and ſhort Land, as <hi>Canaan</hi> is, and poſſeſs it together with the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> are now the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and Spiritual <hi>Jews, Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. As there is a Spiritual, Altar, Temple, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Spiritual Sacrifices, ſo there is a Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for they wreſtle with God to obtain an eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. and they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>udah</hi> as they praiſe God for the obtaining of an everlaſting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 12.11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, We have the time when theſe Promiſes ſhall be moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd, and that in the Days of Chriſt, in his Days <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="5">5thly, We have an honourable and glorious Name given to, and put on the Meſſiah; this is the Name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall be called, <hi>the Lord our</hi> Righteouſneſs. There is ſomething
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41823:9"/>extraordinary imported, and ſignified by this Name, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth Righteouſneſs of us, ſhould himſelf become Righteouſneſs to us; that he who hath impoſed righteous Commands on us, and hath denounced for our diſobedience righteous Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt us, ſhould to ſecure and preſerve us, or be made Righteouſneſs to us: This is admirable and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that Jehovah ſhould provide a Laver to waſh us, and work out a Righteouſneſs to cloath and adorn us. This is ſuch a rare and ſtupendious thing, that the Son of God by this gracious Condeſcention to us, by this merciful Proviſion for us, hath acquired a new, honourable and everlaſting Name.</p>
                  <p>The Words afford us two Points of Doctrine,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in Chriſt's Days <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael, Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> ſhall be moſt eminently, and ſignally ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Jeſus Chriſt is, and ſhall be called, the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41823:9"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That in Chriſt's Days, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael, Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> ſhall be moſt eminently ſaved. For the proſecuting of this Doctrine; 1. I ſhall ſhew you what Days are meant and intended by the Days of Chriſt. 2. What this Salvation is, that ſhall be given forth in his Days. 3. Why Salvation is by way of Excellency ſaid to be beſtowed in his days; and then more eminently communicate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What days are meant by the Days of Chriſt. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Days that begin from the incarnation of the Son of God, and continue and run on to his ſecond coming; theſe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are called his Days, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.7. <hi>In his Days ſhall the Righteous flouriſh;</hi> and theſe days are Long days, for it followeth, <hi>and an abundance of Peace there ſhall be as long as the Moon endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> So that the days of the Meſſiah do run parralel with the Moon as to their duration. God had promiſed to him, that <hi>he ſhould prolong his Days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhould proſper in his Hand,</hi> Iſa. 53.10. It is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Condeſcention, that he whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth were from everlaſting, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41823:10"/>was ancienter than days, ſhould take an Humane Nature, and live a life in it that ſhould be meaſured by days: The Time ſince Jeſus Chriſt was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and manifeſted to the World, is called his days.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is this Salvation that Jeſus Chriſt beſtoweth? I ſhall ſhew you 1. The Nature: 2ly, The Properties and Adjuncts of this Salvation. I ſhall firſt explain the Nature of it; This Salvation hath two parts, 1. A Privative, 2. A Poſitive part.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Privative part. It is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the moſt dreadful Evils, 1. It is Salvation from Sin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> 2 Tit. 14. <hi>he gave himſelf to redeem us from all Iniquity.</hi> His Blood is the precious Red Ink to blot out our Tranſgreſſions; and the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Red Seas to drown the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the Hoſt of our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities in Chriſt, was but baptized in the deep Waters of ſorrow and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but he drowned for ever all our ſins. God made war with Chriſt, to make peace with us, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7. God
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41823:10"/>ſaves by Remiſſion of Sins, <hi>Luke</hi> 77. and by the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. God made him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Severity, that we might be eternal Monuments of Mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſaves from wrath. Jeſus delivers from the wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. laſt. <hi>Being juſtified by his Blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath, through him,</hi> Rom. 5.9. The Apoſtle doth not mention whoſe wrath, but means the wrath of God: This wrath is ſo formidable, and terrible, that all other wrath is as nothing, doth not deſerve the Name of wrath; it is but a falſe, or painted Fire, a Bubble, an empty Name and ſound. God can array all the Creatures, as his Hoſts in Heaven and Earth, to fight againſt Sinners: He can awaken and ſtir up Conſcience, to accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Sinner, and ſo make him both a Burden and a Terrour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God can remember, and ſet all our Trangreſſions before our Sight, and fix our Eyes on this dreadful and diſmaying Object, that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divert or look off from it. God
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41823:11"/>can purſue Sinners with puniſhment in this world, and meet them with more dreadful vengeance in another World; he can ſtrike and ſupport the Criminal at once; he can blow up the Fire of his Anger and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Souls and Bodies of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be eternal Fuel to it; he can make extremity, and eternity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, to meet in the ſame Perſon. It is amazing wrath to make a bundle of Tares, to ſubſiſt, and continue in the Furnace for ever; to be immortal Fuel to an eternal Fire: It is from this dreadful wrath that Jeſus Chriſt ſaves his People.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a poſitive part of this Salvation. 1. Jeſus Chriſt ſaves and quickens us. <hi>The Dead hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear it ſhall live,</hi> John 5.25. As God breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Breath of Life into <hi>Adam</hi>'s formed Body, and he became a living Soul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. ſo Chriſt breathed on his Apoſtles, and ſaid, <hi>Receive you the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> John, 20.22. the Life of Saints, is a Beam of, and a ſtream from the Life of Chriſt, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.20. How noble is their Life? They live
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41823:11"/>by Chriſt's living in them; through the Spirit they are ingrafted into Chriſt, are Branches of the true Tree of Life; they are in him, who is the true God, and Eternal Life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. 2ly, Chriſt ſaves them, and builds them, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.12, 13. The Branches ſhould grow up out of his Place, and he ſhould build the Temple of the Lord; we fell, and were ruined in and by <hi>Adam,</hi> and we lay in Ruines and Rubbiſh, till Chriſt doth lift up his Feet to our Deſolations; doth with Pity behold, and in Mercy raiſe up our Ruins. Satan dwells in, and rejoices over theſe Ruins. Thoſe that are pulled down with reſpect to God, may be ſaid to be built up with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Satan; as Ruins of a Houſe are of no uſe to us, ſo ruined Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are altogether unprofitable to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. O this is great Mercy, for Satan to be diſpoſſed and ejected, and for Souls to be framed as a holy Houſe, and to be built up as a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Temple for God to inhabit, and be worſhipped in. Thoſe that are God's Temples are animated by his Spirit, and are filled with his Glory
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41823:12"/>at once; they are framed to be a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for God, and fitted to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants with him in the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt ſaves waters, and improves our dry Ground, our Barren Land, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. God, ſaith he, <hi>will pour wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on him that is thirſty, and Floods on the dry Ground.</hi> And God thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the meaning of this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, <hi>I will pour my Spirit on thy Seed, and my Bleſſing on thy Off-ſpring.</hi> We are by Nature a wretched, dry and barren piece of Ground; we did ly upon improvement to none, but to the Heavenly Husbandman; it was the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> only that could enrich ſuch a hungry and dry Ground; he that can give the Spirit, as Rivers of Living Water, <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38, 39. He invites Sinners to come and drink: Thirſty Souls may here drink in the very Fountain of Grace, the Spirit, and ſo be enabled to ſend forth Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Rivers, to ſtretch and ſolace o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Chriſt can cultivate, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure the Wilderneſs, cauſe it to be well watered, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.6, 7. and ſo to become a pleaſant <hi>Eden,</hi> a delightful
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41823:12"/>and fruitful Paradiſe to God; as God had a River in the Clouds to improve and enrich <hi>Canaan, Pſal.</hi> 65.6. <hi>Thou viſiteſt the Earth, and watereſt it, thou greatly enricheſt it with the River of God, which is full of Water.</hi> So Chriſt hath a better River with him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and this River he ſends down, and lets it in, and turns it over our dry and barren Land: When <hi>Hannah</hi> was delivered from Barrenneſs, ſhe calls this God's Salvation, and rejoyceth in it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt ſaves and anoints, and and perfumes his Redeemed People, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. <hi>I throughly waſhed away this Blood from thee, and I anointed thee with Oyl.</hi> Here is plain alluſion to thoſe precious and ſweet-ſmelling-Oyls that great Perſons were anointed and perfumed with, <hi>Eſter</hi> 2.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.5. Chriſt doth not only waſh away the guilt of Sin with his Blood, but alſo anoints his People with his Spirit, and its ſweet ſmelling Graces. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are called Chriſtians, becauſe they partake of the Ointment of his Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. And the Church is ſaid to aſcend as Pillars of Smoke, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41823:13"/>with Myrrh and Frankincenſe, and all the powders of the Merchant. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.6. Chriſt doth not only take the ſtink of our Sins, from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of God, by his ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. but alſo perfumes us with the ſweet Odours and Powders of his Graces. The Ointments, the Garments of Saints, caſt out a ſweet ſmell, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He ſaves and cloaths us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. he puts white Raiment on us, that the ſhame of our Nakedneſs may not appear. He takes from Sinners their ſordid Garments, and cloaths them with change of Raiment, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.3, 4. We could not provide any Wedding Cloaths for our ſelves, if Jeſus did not give them to us, and beſtow them on us. <hi>To her was granted to be cloathed in fine Linen, white and clean, which is the Righteouſneſs of Saints,</hi> Rev. 19.8. Jeſus Chriſt doth not only cover us with the Robe of his Righteouſneſs, but alſo adorns and beautifies us with his new Nature; we are made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. We have a Spiritual Underſtanding; we have the Mind of Chriſt. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41823:13"/>and the Bowels or Affections of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.5. We are to put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. his Mind muſt be put upon our Mind, his Will on our Will, his Affections on our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; nothing of our own ſhould be ſeen or appear, but all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Souls ſhould be covered with the Livery of Jeſus Chriſt. This Apparel wears freſher, and will laſt to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Chriſt ſaves and adopts, <hi>John</hi> 4.12. <hi>To as many as received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God.</hi> He was ſo far from envying us, or grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us this Priviledge of Adoption, that he vailed his own Sonſhip under the form of a Servant; he was made under the Law, and died, that we might receive the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. He doth not only ſave Criminals from Execution, but alſo, makes them Heirs of a Kingdom, and an eternal Inheritance, <hi>James</hi> 2.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, I ſhall now ſhew you the Properties and Adjuncts of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41823:14"/>
                  <p n="1">1. It is for the preſent, moſtly a Spiritual Salvation, our Soul's live, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. our Souls find reſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.28. our Souls are ſaved, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. our Souls do delight themſelves in Fatneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. But the Bodies of Saints are often in this World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Poverty, Hardſhips, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, grievous Sufferings, and cruel Deaths; and theſe Evils do cloud the Saints Adoption and vail their State of Spiritual Salvation. This cauſed the Heathens (as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> tells us) to ſay,
<note place="margin">De Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia.</note> that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was an empty thing. If Men had not Riches, Honours, exemption from Sufferings, freedom from outward Evils, and Victory over Enemies; but Chriſt hath not made the Earth, and Plenty of Worldly Enjoyments, as a Jointure to his Spouſe the Church, but tells his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that <hi>in the World they ſhall have Tribulations, John</hi> 16. laſt. that thoſe, that will live Godly, muſt ſuffer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. there is an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable Sentence paſſed on the Old Man, on the natural Body, that it ſhall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41823:14"/>return to the Duſt, and this Sentence muſt be executed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is a Righteous Salvation; this is intimated in the laſt part of the Verſe, <hi>Judah ſhall be ſaved, and that, by him who is the Lord our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> God is juſt in puniſhing ſin on Chriſt, that he may be juſt in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26, 27. God will not tare Believers in pieces, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Threatning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.22. Becauſe the Vail of Chriſt's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, his Soul and Body was divided, and rent in twain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. God may in a righteous way, build up Sinners out of their Ruins, becauſe the Temple of Chriſt's Body hath been deſtroyed, and pull'd down to the Duſt. Jeſus Chriſt, though a Tree of Righteouſneſs, was cut down, that many Branches of Righteouſneſs might ſpring out of this precious Root; he was ſowed in the Duſt, that he might be multiplied, and many might, from this holy Grain, ſpring up to Everlaſting Life, <hi>John</hi> 12.24. God cloathed himſelf with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Vengeance, and loaded Chriſt with ſorrows, that he might
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41823:15"/>cloath us with the Garments of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 1.10. As the living Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was dipt in the Blood of the ſlain Sparrow and ſo let fly, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.5, 6, 7. ſo we have liberty in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous way, by being dyed in Chriſt's Blood. Jeſus Chriſt can marry us, becauſe his Soul and Body were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced, to reconcile us to God. And he can repair and reſtore the beautiful image of God to us, becauſe his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was marred more than any Man's, and his Form more than the Sons of Men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.14. This is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and glory of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, above all the pretended Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in the World, that it ſheweth how God may pardon ſin in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent manner, in a way becoming of himſelf, and not reflect on his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, reproach his Juſtice, or wrong his Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. <hi>It became him, of whom, and for whom, are all things, in bringing many Sons to Glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings. Such an High-Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26. God is more honoured, and his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41823:15"/>Law exalted by the ſufferings of Chriſt, than if we had fell under the Curſe, and lain in Hell for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is a powerful Salvation: God laid the help of Sinners on one that is mighty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. God hath raiſed up for us an Horn of Salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.69. one that is able to pierce through, and to puſh down all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of our Salvation. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation is the mighty God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. no Enemy can ſtand before him, or prevail againſt him; no Diſeaſe is ſo ſtrong, or malignant, but the great Phyſitian can cure it; no Droſs cleaves ſo cloſe to us, but he can ſeparate it from us: Chriſt is a refining Fire to his People, and a conſuming Fire to their Enemies: As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> corrupts and defiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, cleanſe, ſanctify irreſiſtibly. And infallibly he can ſpeak ſo, as to cauſe the Deaf and Dead to hear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.18. <hi>John</hi> 5.25. He can woo ſo, as to cauſe himſelf to be loved, and choſen; he can draw ſo, as to make Sinners to run to him at firſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5. and to run after him ever after, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41823:16"/>The ſpirit of Chriſt is mighty in its Operations; it acts as a ſpirit of Power; it cauſeth Men to paſs under Chriſt's Paſtoral Rod, and brings them under the Bond of the Covenant, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 20.37. It cauſeth Men to approach to God, and dwell in his Houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. It cauſeth Men to walk in God's ways, and to keep his Statutes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. This word (Cauſe) is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and emphatical, and ſignifies the ſpirit's mighty and effectual way of working. It doth not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Arguments, and ſollicite the Souls of the Elect in a moral way, but renews the Will, changes the Heart effectually, inclines men to yield to, and follow after God. The event is not pendulous and uncertain, and ſuſpended on Man's free-will, but Chriſt undertakes that his Sheep ſhall hear his Voice, and he will bring them to his Fold, <hi>John</hi> 10.16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt's Salvation is a full and comprehenſive Salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71. <hi>That we ſhould be ſaved from the Hand of our Enemies, and from all that hate us.</hi> Sin, the World and Death are our Enemies.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41823:16"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Sin is our Enemy. Our Luſts do Satan's work, if he ſhould ſtand ſtill, <hi>James</hi> 1.14, 15. A Man is tempted, and drawn away by his own Luſt; This is a Body of Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. it deforms our Souls as much as Death deforms our Bodies; it makes them corrupt, putrify, and ſtink in the Noſtrils of God; it renders us as unactive for God, as a dead Carcaſe is unſerviceable to Man; it defiles and enſlaves our Souls; lets us only do dead works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. ſuch works as are the fruits of ſpiritual death, and the ſeeds of eternal death: Where it prevails and reigneth, it cauſeth us continually to go a whoring from God, and to riſe up in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt him; it cauſeth us to lead a life of Vanity here, and prepares us for a life of Miſery hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The World is an Enemy: We need the Armour of Righteouſneſs on the Right Hand, to ſecure us from the danger of Proſperity, and the Aamour of Righteouſneſs on our Left Hand, to guard us from the evil of Adverſity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7. Height of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and depth of Miſery, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41823:17"/>are dangerous ſnares, and may prove mortal Enemies to us, if Grace doth not prevent. The World's Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is to draw, and its Furnace is to drive us from God; Satan takes his Bait, and fetches his Weapons from ſome thing in the World. How doth it blow up, and inflame our Hearts? fire and fuel our Luſts? How many are made to forget God, and to think they have no want and need of him, in their Plenty and Abundance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.22. <hi>Job</hi> 1.14.15. <hi>Job</hi> 22.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.31.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Death is an Enemy to God's People, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. it ſtrikes them dumb, and deprives them of the uſe of their Tongues, in praiſing God which is their Glory. Saints as well as others, when they die, go down into ſilence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.18. Death diſables us from working for God in a body of Fleſh; it gives a <hi>Quietus eſt</hi> to one half of us, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth it from the ſervice of God. The Temple in which the ſpirit dwelt, is now pulled down, and ſinks into Duſt and Aſhes; and Death that deprives us of ſo great and glorious
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41823:17"/>an Inhabitant in our Bodies, and takes us off from ſuch noble ſervice, with our Tongues and Members, muſt needs be our Enemy.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt ſaves from theſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: <hi>Sin ſhall not Reign,</hi> Rom. 6.14. and in due time it ſhall ceaſe to be ſin, and ſhall be utterly extirpated out of the People of God. As <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was begun in the death of the Firſt-born of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and was compleated in the drowning of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raob</hi> and all his Hoſt in the Red Sea; ſo the liberty of Saints is begun in deſtroying the reign of beloved ſins, that are the firſt-born of the Old Man, and ſhall be compleated by the total extirpation and deſtruction of all ſin. We are Baptized into the Death and Burial of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. and we muſt be made Partakers of the ſaving Benefit of both. Sin ſhall not only die, but alſo be buried: A Dead Man hath loſt his Command in the Houſe, yet his Carcaſe may remain in it; but when he is to be buried, his Corps is carried out, and he ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any longer to be in the Houſe. So ſin ſhall not only ceaſe to reign, but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41823:18"/>alſo to be in the ſoul; we ſhall be waſhed, and free from every ſpot and wrinkle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The World is foiled and overcome by Chriſt; <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. &amp; laſt. It could not divert or draw him from doing his Father's work and will; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Enemy ſhall not have ſtrength to captivate and deſtroy Believers; they overcame by the Blood of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. Our victorious Saviour hath purchaſed conquering Strength, and merited Victory for us in the midſt of all ſnares and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>We are more than Conquerors, through the Lord Jeſus that hath loved us,</hi> Rom. 8.39.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt will ſave his People from Death, after this Enemy hath not only ſwallowed them up, but digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: Chriſt hath aboliſhed Death already in himſelf, and will aboliſh it alſo in all his People, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. he threatens Death, that holds the Rod over, and threatens the whole World; he menaceth Death, that he will be the plague of Death; a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſeaſe to it. He threatens the Grave that he will deſtroy it, and in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41823:18"/>due time Triumphant Saints ſhall ſing this Song, <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting?</hi> O Death, what haſt thou gotten by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our Bodies, they are alive again? <hi>O Grave where is thy Victory?</hi> what haſt thou gotten by taking away all the ſhape of a Body, and crumbling it into Duſt? 3ly. This Body is now reſtor'd, our Particles of Duſt are gathered together, and formed into a Body like the glorious Body of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55.57. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. Chriſt will, in Living Saints at the laſt day, ſwallow up Mortality of Life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. and, in dead Saints, he will ſwallow up Death into Victory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, There are thoſe that hate Saints; and ſo wicked Men and Satan do; they hate them, becauſe they bare the Image, and live the Life, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the intereſt of God; but the wicked cannot kill the Souls of the Saints, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. and Satan, though he may deſtroy the natural Life, yet he ſhall not quench the Life of God in them; and in due time, the Saints ſhall tread down the wicked, they ſhall be as Aſhes under the ſoles of their Feet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2, 3. and the God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41823:19"/>of Peace ſhall ſhortly tread Satan under the Feet of Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This is an everlaſting Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.17. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved in the Lord, with an everlaſting ſalvation; Saints ſhall have a full, and an eternal Victory, as God did ſwear to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that <hi>his Seed ſhould poſſeſs the Gates of their Enemies,</hi> Gen. 22.17. When, not only the Field Army is beaten, but the ſtrong Towns and Cities are taken, then there is a total and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conqueſt. Saints ſhall be ſaved from Sin, Sinners and Satan for ever; and this Salvation muſt needs be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, for it is founded on the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.24. and the eternal Redemption of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. There is no poſſibility for glorified Saints to ſin or fall; there ſhall no Serpent creep into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradiſe to tempt. Saints ſhall never make Forfeitures of it, or be driven out of it; they ſhall there eat of the Tree of Life, and live for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41823:19"/>
                  <p n="6">6. This Salvation. Salvation is joined with Vengeance executed on our ſpiritual Enemies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.4. <hi>Your God ſhall come with vengeance;</hi> God ſhall come with a Recompence, and ſave you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.2. the acceptable Year of the Lord, is come with a Day of Vengeance. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not be delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or be freed from <hi>Babylon,</hi> but the Firſt-born of <hi>Egypt, Pharaoh</hi> and all his Hoſt muſt be ſwallowed up, and deſtroy'd, and <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Empire muſt ceaſe, and her Kingdom be deſtroyed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.18.26. So the Elect cannot have liberty and ſalvation, but Satan himſelf muſt be deſtroy'd, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. and his works alſo be rootod out of the Hearts of Men, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5. O what Mercy is this to Believers, that the wrath of God is turned away from them, and that the vengeance of God falls on Satan and Sin; that Sin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed, but Sinners are juſtified and ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1.33.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But why is it ſaid, that <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> dwell ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Days of Chriſt? why is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41823:20"/>ſo eminently put on Goſpel times.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, though Saints before Chriſt were ſaved, yet ſtill it was with an Eye to, and proſpect of Chriſt's coming: If Chriſt had not been exhibited in the Fleſh, and bled and died in our Natures, no Sinners could have been ſaved: The Faith, Hope, Salvation of Saints, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Goſpel-times and days; Chriſt was a Lamb ſlain in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, and in the Typical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices from the Foundation of the World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3. God took Chriſt's word, when he became a ſurety; he depended on his performance of his Promiſes, and his Oblation of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and the Eyes of Saints was to him, and upon him, <hi>John</hi> 9.56. <hi>Your Father Abraham</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the <hi>Jews) rejoyced that he might ſee my day, he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> He ſaw the day of Chriſt's Birth, in the Birth of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> He ſaw the day of his Death, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was bound, laid on the Altar, and ready to be offered up in Sacrifice; and in the Lamb that was ſubſtituted in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Room,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41823:20"/>which pointed out Chriſt, that was our Exchange, and ſo our Ranſom and Redeemer. The words that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> ſpake, was the Language of Saints in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.18. <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation, O Lord.</hi> Our Saints of the New Teſtament, have this Priviledge and Advantage, that they can ſpeak as <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luke 2.29, 30. <hi>Mine Eyes have ſeen thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which thou haſt prepared before the Face of all People.</hi> The Prophets were but Seeds-Men, they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to the Church a Promiſe of the Meſſiah to come, <hi>John</hi> 4.37.38. but the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the New Teſtament are Harveſt-men; they relate the Hiſtory, and preach the glad Tidings of Chriſt's Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Death, Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention into Heaven; and the Saints of the Old Teſtament enjoyed no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Liberty, but with reſpect to the Ranſom to be paid by Chriſt; and no Legacies had been beſtowed, but in proſpect of the Death of Chriſt. There is therefore great Reaſon why it ſhould be ſaid with an Emphaſis, that <hi>in Chriſt's Days</hi> Judah <hi>ſhould be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41823:21"/>ſaved.</hi> But what is the benefit of Chriſt's Days? What peculiar influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have they on Salvation?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It may well be ſaid, that in Chriſt's Days Men are ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 1ſt, That now Chriſt is incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; he that made all things is now made Fleſh, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.2.14. And we have a two-fold Advantage, for our Salvation, by Chriſt's Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is now become our Brother, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.1. and ſo, hath right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us, as he is our near Kinſman, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.47, 48, 49. If an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> did ſell himſelf for a Servant, after he was ſold, his Brother, or any that was near of Kin to him, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him, and ſo reſtore him again to liberty. We are by the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and ſince, by our ſinful choice, ſold under ſin; we know of no Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Brother that could give to God a Ranſom for us. It was God's infinite and free Mercy, to raiſe up Jeſus Chriſt, in our Nature, to pay a Ranſome for us; we did not think or dream of ſuch a Brother or Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. No meer Creature ſhould have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41823:21"/>undertook the work of Redemption, but he muſt have miſcarried, and ſunk under it; but Chriſt is fitted now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us, becauſe he is God's Son, and our Brother.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt as our Brother, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Kinſman, is fit to be our God, or Avenger of Blood; he that was the Kinſman of one that was ſlain, did claim a right to avenge his Blood on him that ſhed it. So Chriſt by aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Nature, is fitted to avenge us of Sin and Satan, that are our great Enemies, to deſtroy thoſe that have ruined and undone us; the ſame Hebrew Word, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies both a Redeemer and an Avenger; ſo it is ſaid God ſhall come with Vengeance and ſave us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly, Jeſus Chriſt hath now made his Soul an Offering for ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. He came to make atonement, and is a propitiation for our ſins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. he made Peace by the Blood of his Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. and reconciles Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God by his Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. And this is obſervable, that the Year of Jubilee began from the day of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.9.10. Then Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41823:22"/>were reſtored to their Liberty and thoſe that had alienated their Lands, recovered their ſold Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances. Even ſo Chriſt having now made at Atonement, he can and doth proclaim a Year of Jubilee, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, and the Releaſing of Sins Servants, God's Priſoners, and the Devil's Captives; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.2. as in <hi>David</hi>'s Days, when a Peſtilence was ſent by God for numbring the People, firſt, God bid the Angel that came to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſtay his Hand, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. But when a Sacrifice was offered, he bid him to put up his Sword, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.27. So in the times of the Law, God did but as it were ſtay his Hand: Sins were ſaid to be paſſed by, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the forbearance of God, that Time is called a Time of Forbearance, and God ſtaid his Hand from puniſhing thoſe that did look to Chriſt to come. But now the great Sacrifice is offered up; God's Sword is ſheathed; and he can magnify Grace, through the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and ſatisfaction of Chriſt; it may reign through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20.21. <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41823:22"/>Chriſt being lifted upon the Croſs, will draw all to him, John</hi> 12.32. <hi>All,</hi> that is <hi>very many,</hi> compared with the <hi>few,</hi> that were drawn before a Dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, Chriſt hath now paid a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. and purchaſed a Church by his own Blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. And therefore Chriſt hath now juſt ground to come to the Priſon Door of Sinners, and to call them forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.9. <hi>That thou maiſt ſay to the Priſoners go forth, and to them that are in darkneſs, ſhew your ſelves.</hi> Come with boldneſs into the preſence of God; appear and ſhew your ſelves with confidence in the Heavenly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.

                  <p n="4">4thly, Chriſt hath now ſealed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and eſtabliſhed his Teſtament by means of Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. He that might have given a Sanction to to the Threatning, by our Blood, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41823:23"/>have executed the Curſe in our Death, hath ratified the Promiſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his Teſtament by his own Death. Chriſt hath given Vigour and Strength to the Promiſes, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crucified through weakneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. and hath given Life to his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament by his own Death; and he is riſing again to be his own Executor. Now he can fulfil the Promiſes of the New Covenant, and beſtow the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies of his new Teſtament, and that eſpecially becauſe Chriſt is ſuch a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, as by his death doth purchaſe of God, all the Legacies he bequeaths in his Teſtament, which no other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator doth. All the Mercies of the Everlaſting Covenant, are the ſure Mercies of this Spiritual <hi>David,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. they are ſure, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is riſen from the Dead to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.34. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt may freely and lawfully give forth his own.</p>
                  <p n="5">5hty, Now Chriſt is ſaved; and therefore in a full capacity to ſave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Thy King cometh to thee,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Salvatus ipſemet ut de brevi tranſitu in locum. Saved.</hi> Chriſt had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41823:23"/>many Adverſaries, and did encounter with mighty Enemies; they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured totally to cruſh Chriſt, and wholly to ſwallow him up; it was of great concernment to the whole Church of God, that Chriſt ſhould be ſaved. The Holy Ghoſt therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated that Prayer to the Saints, to be put up for Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.25. <hi>Save now we beſeech thee, we heſeech thee now ſend Proſperity;</hi> now was the time of War and utter Deſtruction, there were many aſſociated and united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25, 26, 27. He is ſtiled Child Jeſus, Enemies thought eaſily to deſtroy him; <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> Many Dogs were hunting down this Morning Hart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. and the Title of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. And it was that which the Church deſired, and Chriſt himſelf alſo pray'd for, that he might be delivered from their cruel and devouring Mouths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.29. <hi>I am Poor and Needy, let thy Salvation ſet me up on high.</hi> And Chriſt was heard in what he pray'd for: He was taken from Priſon and Judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8. From Man's Priſon, Tribunal, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41823:24"/>Judgment, and God did ſet him up on high, even in a glorious Throne, far above the reach and rage of all his Enemies; that Chriſt that is ſo perfectly ſaved himſelf, can fully ſave us. He that did wreſt himſelf out of the Hands of his Foes, can alſo reſcue us from the Power of all our Enemies; the day of Chriſt's Weakneſs is paſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. and the day of his Power is now come, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6thly, Chriſt is now Perfected, and being made Perfect, he is fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Author of Eternal Salvation to thoſe that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.

All the Rounds or Rongs of the Spiritual Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that reacheth from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are compleat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12, 13, 14. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.33, 34. Chriſt hath cloathed himſelf with our Fleſh, he hath died, is riſen again, is aſcended to Heaven, is at the Right Hand of God, to make Interceſſion for us. His Prieſtly Garments are ſprinkled with his own Blood; and ſo he is fitted to enter into the Heavenly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41823:24"/>and to appear in the Preſence of God; the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> were to have their Prieſtly Garments ſprinkled with the Blood of a Sacrifice, before they could officiate in the Sanctuary, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.21. Chriſt's own Death did conſecrate him, as a Prieſt for ever, and perfect him for the great work of Interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. laſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7thly, Chriſt is now Victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his, and our Enemies; he hath overcome the World, <hi>John</hi> 16. laſt. he hath made Reconciliation for Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, yea, made an end of ſin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. he hath aboliſhed Death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. by taſting it for a few Hours, he hath ſwallowed it up for ever: By Death, he hath deſtroy'd him that hath the power of Death, even the Devil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. As a Goaler hath the power of the Law to keep a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor in Priſon, and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner hath the power of the Law to put him to Death; ſo Sinners hath broken the Law, and incurred the Penalty; Satan hath the power of the Curſe, to cut off, and deſtroy Sinners. But Chriſt hath ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, turned Satan out of his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41823:25"/>Office, ſtript him of his Power, as to thoſe that believe. The Curſe is the Armour that this Strong Man truſts in, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.22. And Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, by being made a Curſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. And Chriſt hath now the Key of Hell, and Death: the Key of Hell to ſhut it, that the Souls of his People may not enter into it, and the Key of Death, to reſcue and bring forth the Bodies of his People out of the Grave. <hi>He hath led Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Pſal.</hi> 68.18. and triumphed over the Enemies of our Salvation; the Captain of our Salvation is entred in triumph into his Royal City above; as he hath overcome in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo now he can overcome in us. His ſtrength is perfected in our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: It is diſcovered to be moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, when we are moſt weak and low; when we ſeem as Chriſt's Soldiers, to lye in the open Field, and to be expoſed to manifold Inconveniences and Sufferings from the rage and fury of the World, then the power of Chriſt is ſpread as a Tent over us, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. Chriſt the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41823:25"/>Captain of our Salvation, can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with, and mighty in all his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ride in triumph through the World on poor Worms. He that hath wounded the Head of the Old Serpent, and broke the ſtrength of Satan, is able to foil all his ſcatter'd Forces, that yet remain, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.2. He rideth forth Conquering, and to Conquer, and turneth the Battel even to the Gates of Hell. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.6. Chriſt the true <hi>David</hi> doth ſuccour his People out of the Heavenly City, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.3 and ſend to his Fighting Soldiers the Supplies of his Spirit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19.</p>
                  <p n="8">8thly, Chriſt is alive, and lives for evermore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. And Chriſt doth not live idly, but to make interceſſion for all that come to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. He lives to execute his Teſtament, ſprinkle his Blood, and apply his Redemption. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, much more ſhall we be ſaved by his Life.</hi> Chriſt hath gone through with the moſt hard, difficult, and painful part of his work; he gave
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41823:26"/>his Life a Ranſom, he poured out his Soul unto the Death; and will he neglect or omit the eaſieſt part of his work? He may live and ſave us; he needs not to bleed again, to go forth into any more Storms, or to be ſet up as a Mark of God; he may ſit in his Throne, he may wear his glittering Crown, and reign in his Glory, and do al the reſt that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to accompliſh and compleat our Salvation. Becauſe Chriſt liveth, his People ſhall live alſo, <hi>John</hi> 14.19. Chriſt liveth, and therefore his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſhall not die in the World. Our Redeemer liveth to quicken our Spirits, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26. Now by his Spirit, to receive our departing Souls, and to revive our dead Bodies. Chriſt is alive to woo his Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8. and marry her, <hi>Romans</hi> 7.4. to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and ſubdue his Enemies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.13, 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.2.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall come now to the uſe of the Doctrine.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Shall Men be moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaved in Chriſt's Days, then we may be inform'd of the wonderful
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41823:26"/>Mercy of God; of the admirable Grace of Chriſt, that we have ſuch days of the Meſſiah. The days due to Sinners, are days of Puniſhment, days of Vengeance, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.22. A day of Evil, a day of Deſtruction, is properly called a Sinners day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.13. <hi>The Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth that his Day is coming.</hi> Ezek. 21.25. <hi>And thou Prophane Prince of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>whoſe day is come, when Iniquity ſhall have an end.</hi> By theſe Paſſages of Scripture, we may ſee what days Sinners deſerve, and what days they might have looked for. If God had dealt with the World according to the rigour of his Juſtice, the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Curſe of his Law there, would have been no other days, but the days of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> In his days Sin reigns unto Death, and Death reigns, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14.21. How terrible would it have been, if there had been no other days, but days for Sin and Death to Reign in? It is through the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that we have an Accepted time, and a day of Salvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Men would do nothing elſe but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41823:27"/>ſow the Seeds of Woe here, and reap a full Harveſt of Miſery here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. They would ſin in this World, and ſuffer in the World to come; they would walk contrary to God in time, and God would walk contrary to them to Eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If Sinners are ſaved moſt eminently in Chriſt's Days, O then examine your ſelves whether Chriſt's Salvation be applied to you; whether God doth cloth you with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, that hath cloathed me with the Garments of Salvation.</hi> Have you obtained the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that is in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. Try your ſelves, by propoſing to your own Souls theſe following Queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Were your Eyes ever opened; liberty of ſight makes way for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Soul; the opening of Mens Eyes, is the firſt ſtep that Chriſt takes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.7. <hi>He is appointed to open the Blind Eyes, to bring out the Priſoners from the Priſon,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41823:27"/>and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the Priſon-houſe.</hi> As thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that were born in <hi>Babylon,</hi> if they were not better inform'd, would account <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> to be the Native Country of their Fathers, and that they had always dwelt there, and ſo be contented to ſtay in the Land of their Captivity: They therefore needed to have their Eyes opened, that they might know that <hi>Chaldea</hi> and the other Countries under the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Empire, were the Land of their Captivity. That God in wrath had ſlung them out into this ſtrange Country, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.16. That their ſins had driven them hither, and ſcattered them among their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Even ſo Sinners need to have their Eyes opened, that they may know whoſe they are, and where they are. Men do not acknowledge, and conſider that they are under the Law of Sin, the power of Satan, and the wrath of God. Sinners do not know themſelves to be Condemned Men and Women, ſhut up under a Sentence of Death, and reſerved to the Day of Wrath and Execution, <hi>Job</hi> 21.30. Men are as careleſs and unconcerned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41823:28"/>as if they had not degenerated and fallen from God; as if their Natures were not corrupted and depraved; as if Mankind never knew a better ſtate, but were always as vitious, looſe and wicked, as now they are. Could Sinners be ſo quiet, yea, be ſo merry and jovial as they are, if they knew they were God's Priſoners, and that the Day of Judgment and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance was at hand. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how it is with you; did God ever open your Eyes, and let in Light into your dark Priſon? Did you ever feel the Chains of Guilt that are about you? the burden of Iniquity that is upon you? Have you ever applied the Threatnings and Curſe of the Law to your own Souls, and ſo have in the bitterneſs of your Souls, cried out that you are undone. None are fit to be Chriſt's Patients, but ſuch as are broken in Heart, or are capable of Chriſt's Comforts, if they be not firſt Mourners in <hi>Zion,</hi> Iſa. 61.1.2. The Prodigal came to himſelf, and was ſenſible of his Miſery, before he took a Reſolution that he would ariſe and come to his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 25.17.18.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41823:28"/>Did you ever ſee your worſt and moſt dangerous Enemies to be within you? Have you been made ſenſible of your vain Minds, hard and whoriſh Hearts, and carnal Affections?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Were you ever effectually called? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>He hath ſaved and called as with an holy Calling.</hi> Hath God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, ſo as to ſave you from your unbelief and impenitency? Hath God ſpoken to you with a ſtrong hand? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.11. Hath he laid the hand of his Power on your Hearts. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſpake to <hi>Lot</hi> with a ſtrong hand; they did not only exhort him to haſten and be gone out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but when he lingred, they laid hold on the Hand of <hi>Lot,</hi> of his Wife, and of his Two Daughters, and brought them out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 19.15, 16. Even ſo Chriſt ſpeaks with a ſtrong hand to the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.4.5. He not only pleaded, and uſed Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments why ſhe ſhould riſe and open to him, but he put in the Hand of his Spirit by the Hole of the Door. His Hand was as a Key fitted to the Wards of the Lock; he touched her Breaſts, and moved her Bowels,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41823:29"/>wrought on her Affections, and then ſhe roſe to open to her Beloved. Hath Chriſt ever apprehended you; as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.12. It is ſaid the Converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould follow the Church in Chains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.14. <hi>They ſhall come after thee in Chains.</hi> Hath Chriſt caſt ſweet Chains of Light and Love about your Souls, and thereby Powerfully draw you?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Did you ever fly for Refuge, and come to Chriſt? The Heirs of Promiſe are ſaid to fly for Refuge, to take hold of the hope ſet before them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. Men will not fly, if they do not ſee a Cauſe, and know a danger that is towards them. Hath it been with you, as with <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, it did fly Abroad, but found all to be cover'd with Water, and that there was no reſt for the ſole of her Feet; and therefore ſhe returned to the Ark; and <hi>Noah</hi> ſtretched out his Hand, and pluck'd her unto him into the Ark, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.39. So have you ſeen nothing but a Deluge of ſin and wrath out of Chriſt, and therefore have fled to him, and he hath ſtretched out the Hard of his Spirit, and plucked
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41823:29"/>you into himſelf? Have you joyned, and given your ſelves to the Lord, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. For in the event Chriſt will ſave no more, but thoſe that are in him, and of his Body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. He is the head and Saviour of his Body. All out of Chriſt muſt certainly ſink into the mighty Sea of the wrath of God, and periſh everlaſtingly. O therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether you have ground to conclude, that you are in him, who is the true God, and Eternal Life. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. As thoſe Beaſts that God would ſave, were by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to come and enter into the Ark, ſo thoſe that God will, ſuch are drawn to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.44.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Have you experienced this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the ſeveral parts of it, to be executed upon you? Hath Chriſt bound up your broken Hearts, healed your wounded Spirits? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 61.1. Hath he refined you from your Droſs? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.23. Hath he circumciſed your Hearts, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. Have you felt Chriſt laying hold on your Hearts, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the filthy Fore-skin that was upon them? <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. Hath ſelf-love
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41823:30"/>been moderated, reduced within its bounds? The Waters covered all at firſt, till God ſaid, <hi>Let the Waters be gathered together into one Place,</hi> Gen. 1.9. So ſelf-love overſpreads the Soul, till Chriſt doth bound and bank it in, and raiſes up the love of God in our Souls. What hath the Old Man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in you? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. Have your Luſts received a deadly wound? Or are you made free from the Law of Sin and Death? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. And doth it not reign in your Mortal Bodies? Do you not obey it in the Luſts thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. God juſtified Chriſt by raiſing him up from the Dead. So the Gift of the Spirit to quicken us, it's the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of our Juſtification. When God paſſes the Sentence of Life on Men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. then he breaths and puts the Spirit of Life into them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. As the Beaſts ſaved in the Ark, were planted in the likeneſs of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Death and Reſurrection, they entred into the Ark, were buried in it, and roſe and came out of it, with <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo have we been planted in the likeneſs of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. Hath Chriſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41823:30"/>pick'd up, and purged out Satan's Leaven out of our Souls, and laid his own Leaven in our Hearts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.33.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Have you anſwered Chriſt's ends in your Salvation? He ſayes, <hi>that we being delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the days of our lives,</hi> Luke 1.74.75. Of old in War, thoſe that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors did ſave alive, did promiſe to become Servants. <hi>Serva, &amp; ſerviam;</hi> Save me, and I will ſerve thee, was the words of a foiled Enemy, in danger to be deſtroyed. O hath Chriſt ſaved us, when he might have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and doth not this Grace influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and oblige our Souls? How much did Chriſt deny himſelf, to ſave us? and ſhall not we deny our ſelves to ſerve him? Hath not Chriſt's ſelf-denial redeemed us from Self-ſeeking? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. He died, that thoſe that live might not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live to themſelves, but to him that died for them. Hath not Chriſt bought our Souls, and hired our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for ever? Hath God cloathed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41823:31"/>us with Garments of Salvation? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. theſe will be alſo Garments of Praiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.3. <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us, that if a Soldier was ſaved from Death in a Battel, by his Fellow-Soldiers, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The Tribunes did judge, that he that was ſaved, ſhould crown him that ſaved him, and through his whole Life, he ſhould honour him as his Father, and do all things to him and for him, as if he were his natural Parent. Surely, if Chriſt hath ſaved us from the wrath of God, the Paw and power of Satan, we ſhall be induced to Honour, Obey and Glorify our Saviour and Redeemer. <hi>Every Day ſhall he be praiſed, Pſal.</hi> 72.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3d. If Sinners are eminently ſaved in Chriſt's Days, then I would earneſtly preſs, and exhort you, to ſeek after Salvation. For Men to be ſaved, is the glory of Chriſt's Days; and will you caſt a Reproach and Infamy on Chriſt's Days, by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41823:31"/>of Salvation, and running upon Deſtruction? Will you envy and grudge to Jeſus Chriſt the glory of ſaving you? and will you put this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on Satan, that in a day of Light he is able to blind you, and in a day of Salvation to deſtroy you? and when ſo much is revealed, to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his Baits, and to ſpoil his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, that yet you ſee Reaſon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in your fooliſh and pernicious Choice, and to adhere to your bitter and mortal Enemy? Shall Death and Hell have a Harveſt? ſhall Satan cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate and inſlave in a Day of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Two things I ſhall inſiſt on, to proſecute this Exhortation. 1. I ſhall lay before you ſome Motives to enforce this uſe of Exhortation. 2. I ſhall lay down ſome Directions as to what you are to do, in order to the obtaining and aſſuring this Salvation to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall propound and preſs ſome Motives to ſtir you up to ſeek after Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 1. This Salvation is a very great Salvation; if we conſider firſt the way of purchaſing and procuring
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41823:32"/>of it. The Son of God aſſumed the nature of a Creature, emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and caſt a thick Vail over all his Glory: How was Chriſt's immenſity, his omnipotency, his eternity, his omniſciency vailed, by taking a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo weak, confined to a Place, and that did exiſt but lately, and was to grow in Wiſdom, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.52. Chriſt became a Surety, a Servant, a Sacrifice; was made Sin, and a Curſe to appeaſe God's Wrath, and redeem us from Deſtruction. The Son of God was arreſted as a Debtor to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice; was arrained as a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſentenced and executed as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor; he hung on an infamous Tree, among heinous Sinners; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Captive of Death, and lay in a dark and cold Grave. All this Jeſus Chriſt yielded and ſubmitted to, for to procure Salvation. And ſhall we deſpiſe or neglect a Salvation that was purchaſed by ſuch an amazing Condeſcention, and ſuch grievous ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Son of God? Shall we undervalue and contemn the Travel of his Soul, and the purchaſe of his Blood. If the Ocean had been leſſened
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41823:32"/>to a Drop, it had not been ſo much, as for the Son of God to be made Man. If a Prince ſhould execute Ten Thouſand of his Subjects for a Crime, it had not been ſo much, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge his own Son to a cruel death for an Offence; ſo, for God's Sword to awake againſt his only begotten Son, was a more ſtrange act of Juſtice, than if he had executed all Mankind. And will you not ſet a Price on that Salvation that is the product of the ſorrows and ſufferings of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Salvation is great, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs of the Evils that we are ſaved and freed from.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, It is a Salvation from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.11. <hi>He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond Death.</hi> This is the hurting and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Death; the firſt Death only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates Soul and Body, but this Death ſeparates God and the Soul for ever. The firſt Death deprives the Body of any ſenſe or feeling of Pain, but this ſecond Death is attended with the moſt acute ſenſe and feeling of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Torments. This Death kills
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41823:33"/>all that is ſweet and pleaſant, and leaves only a Carcaſe of being; a bare Stock for God to graft Sufferings and Torments on: It is ſad for Men to be, only to be miſerable. For to be a Footſtool for God to tread on, and a Mark for him to ſhoot at: As Grapes when trod in the Wine-preſs, all that is grateful and delightful, is ſqueez'd out of them; only a dry and harſh Husk remains and is left. Even ſo ſhall it be, when Sinners ſhall be trod in the Wine-Preſs of the Wrath of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Believers are preſerved from a dark and diſmal Priſon. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of the Spirits in Priſon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. All light of Joy and Comfort is ſhut out of this Priſon; all wo, evil and miſery is ſhut up in it: This Priſon is not only a Place of Confinement, but alſo of Execution; here is the Furnace of unquenchable Fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.42. Sinners fall now into the Hands of God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. The Sovereign Judge executes his own Sentence.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41823:33"/>
                  <p n="3">3dly, Chriſt ſaves from a bottomleſs Pit: Hell is ſo called, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.3. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall fall lower and lower, and ſink deeper and deeper into Miſery, and never know when they are at the bottom of their Miſery; they ſhall never ſay, that now they know the utmoſt that God can inflict, or the worſt that they can ſuffer: As in Heaven there will ſtill be new Viſions of Glory, ſo in Hell there will be new Scenes of Miſery for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, Chriſt ſaves and keeps from a Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10.14. This Expreſſion, <hi>a Lake of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> alludes to <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Puniſhment. God deſtroy'd it with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from Heaven, and turn'd the Place on which <hi>Sodom</hi> and the other Cities ſtood, into a dead-Sea, or ſtanding ſtinking Lake. It is dreadful for Sinners to be drowned in this Lake of Fire, and yet never to die. Luſts are ſaid to drown Men in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Perdition, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. and yet they exiſt, and continue to feel this tormenting Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41823:34"/>this Lake of Fire will never ebb away, or dry up.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. This Salvation may well be called great, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. if we conſider that Believers not only are freed from the greateſt Evils, but alſo enjoy the higheſt and beſt Good. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> joins everlaſting Glory with God's Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. that the Elect may obtain the Salvation that is in Chriſt, together with Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Glory.

They ſhall have an Eternal Day, made by the Light of God's Countenance; an everlaſting Feaſt, by the manifeſtation and diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Love, as a Banner over them.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 2. We do exceedingly need this Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We are Children of Wrath by nature, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. and ſo Hell is our Inheritance. The Wrath of God might deſcend, and be poured out on us, as ſoon as we draw our firſt Breath in the World; the Veſſels of Wrath are then fitted for Deſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. and it is wonderful Patience, that God forbears Sinners ſo long. God had ground for a Controverſy, juſt cauſe for Enmity againſt us, as ſoon as we were born. God then ſaw the Plague of, and the evil Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in our Hearts; ſuch Tares might have been rooted up; ſuch Weeds have been rooted out, ſuch corrupt Trees have been cut down long ago.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41823:35"/>Do Men ſuffer Weeds to grow up and ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are Children of Diſobedience by Practice, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. and ſo Hell is our Purchaſe. We went aſtray as ſoon as we were born, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.3. Our Whoriſh Hearts have continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Lord, our whole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate eſtate, hath been nothing elſe but Barrenneſs and Enmity, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Rebellion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.23.30. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid to have done nothing of all that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, but had only done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evil, and provoked God to Anger. The Carnal Mind is Enmity to God, is not ſubject to him, nor indeed can be. <hi>They that are in the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8.7.8. Sinners on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſow the Seeds of their own wo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fuel to the Fire of God's Anger, and fit themſelves for Deſtruction. As a Fountain caſteth out its Water, ſo they caſt forth their wickedneſs. <hi>An evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart, brings forth evil things,</hi> Jer. 6.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35. All Mens doings, is to undo themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41823:35"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Sinners owe God glory to be raiſed out of their ſhame and miſery. Sins are called Debts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12. Men by tranſgreſſing, rob God of his Authority and Honour, and are bound to make Reſtitution to him; and God as a Righteous Judge, owes Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto them. God is a Debter to his Threatning and Juſtice, to take Vengeance on Tranſgreſſors; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>He will repay Fury to his Adverſaries,</hi> Iſa. 59.18. <hi>He will render Anger to his Enemies,</hi> Iſa. 66.15. God will not always forbear Sinners, or be in Debt to them. <hi>The Wages of ſin is Death,</hi> Rom. 6. laſt, and it becomes the Juſt Judge of the World, to pay the Servants of Sin their Wages. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety ſhall not be joined with Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. God will diſtribute a Portion of Sorrows, and divide an inheritance of Torments and Miſery to Satan's Children, <hi>Job</hi> 31.23. God will be glorified in their everlaſting ſhame, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.22. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sinners are in God's Priſon, they are in Satan's ſhare, they are under the curſe of the Law.</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:41823:36"/>
                  <p n="1">1. They are in God's Priſon. There would be no need for Chriſt to Preach the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. if Men were not in God's Priſon, there were no need to call them forth into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.9. if they were not in Bondage. There is an outer Priſon of God, from which Men may be brought, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.7. but there is an inner Priſon, a deep Dungeon, from whence there is no Redemption. Though Tranſgreſſors now think themſelves to have liberty, and walk at large, yet God's Eye is ſtill over them, the Chains of Guilt bind their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: They are Condemned Men, both by the Law for their Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and by the Goſpel for their Unbelief. God's Hand hath faſt hold of them; their Iniquities are before God's Eyes to provoke him to abhor them; they clamour loud in his Ears to pluck down his Vengeance on them, their Crimes are both Alledgers and Witneſſes againſt them; they cannot fly or eſcape from God: If they run to the ends of the Earth, they go but to the ſides of their Priſon. The
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41823:36"/>
                     <hi>Jews</hi> were in danger of Death, in all the Provinces of <hi>Abaſuerus</hi> his Empire, by virtue of the Edict given forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; yet it was poſſible for them to Travel out of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi>'s Empire, where his Law would not reach them: But Sinners cannot get out of the Bounds of God's Empire, the whole World is his Dominion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. laſt. If Men ſtay in God's Priſon, they ſhall be certainly brought forth, to be condemned and executed in the Day of Wrath, <hi>Job</hi> 21.30.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sinners are in Satan's Snare, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. laſt, every ſweet, beloved reigning ſin, is the Snare of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Fowler, of this cruel Hunter. Wo be to thoſe that continue in this Snare. There is a time when a Snare is <hi>taken up,</hi> (as the Expreſſion is, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 3.5.) Satan will viſit his Snares, and take the Prey catched in them, into Hell: In this Den, the roaring Lion will devour what he hath taken in his Snare.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sinners are under the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. We needed not Chriſt to Redeem us from the curſe of the Law, if we were not under it;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41823:37"/>and the curſe of the Law, is the curſe of the Law-giver: This is dreadful for God's Anger to be ſo kindled, for his Spirit to be ſo imbittered, as to curſe his own Creature. God that wiſheth evil to, and deſigns evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Creatures, is able to execute his own Curſe; his Curſe is not a cauſeleſs, but a righteous Curſe: It is the Curſe of him that is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, that knows what Mens Offences are, and where the Offenders are: It is the Curſe of him that fills Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; there is no flying from him. It is the Curſe of him that is wiſe in Heart, and therefore can deviſe the moſt dreadful Evils, and that is mighty in ſtrength, <hi>Job</hi> 1.4. and therefore can execute them. God lives for ever to execute this Curſe, to pour wrath into, and blow eternal Flames over the Soul. The meaning and dreadful effects of this Curſe, is expounded by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Go, ye curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> Men curſe, when they are weak, and not able to puniſh us; when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was weak, and the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:41823:37"/>were too hard for him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.39. and ſo he could not puniſh <hi>Joah</hi> and <hi>Abiſhai</hi> for the Murder of <hi>Abner,</hi> yet he curſeth them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.28, 29. But God that curſeth not without a cauſe, hath an Almighty Arm to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his own Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is a black, diſmal Storm that hangs over the Heads of Sinners, in the Clouds of God's Threatnings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>On the Wicked the Lord will rain Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, and an Horrible Tempeſt; this ſhall be the Portion of their Cup.</hi> They that drink in Iniquity now, <hi>Job</hi> 5.16. ſhall drink in Wrath at laſt, <hi>Joh</hi> 21.20. Sinners ſhall not be able to fly from this Storm; God will rain Snares to take hold of them, and to hold them faſt. God's Ax is at the Root of Sinners, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. his Arrows are levell'd at their Hearts; all the Sufferings they feel now, are but the firſt-fruits of Wo, earneſt of a more grievous Vengeance; Harbingers and Forerunners of an Everlaſting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It is terrible, when the Sins of Men are yet with them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.12. when the Breach is open, to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41823:38"/>let in a Deluge of Miſery on them, and the Sentence of Death ſtands in full force againſt them. O ſhould not this affect and affright the Souls of Sinners, that God is ready to arreſt them, and tear them in pieces; to ſet them up as his Mark, to pierce their Hearts, and cleave their Reins with his Arrows, and to conſume them with the Fire of his Anger. Though Gods Judgments are now far above, out of their ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.5. yet the Wicked ſhall ſee their Deſtruction, <hi>Job</hi> 21.20.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Chriſt will come to execute the Vengeance that the Law denounces, and that Chriſt threatens, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8.9. He that came at firſt with Beams of Love, will come a ſecond time in Flames of Wrath, to avenge the Quarrel of deſpiſed Grace, and of abuſed Mercy. Then Sinners ſhall feel the truth of God's Threatnings, that there will be a Day of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.5. a Day of Wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. a Day of Deſtruction, <hi>Job</hi> 21.30. Though Chriſt will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for Salvation to thoſe that look for him, yet he will alſo be revealed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41823:38"/>to remember and puniſh thoſe that forget God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.22. to burn Adulterous Souls, and to deſtroy Obſtinate and impenitent Rebels.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. You can have no true, ſolid or laſting joy, except you partake of this Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation.</hi> This Prayer of <hi>David</hi> is obſervable; it was not his Palace, his Crown, or his Throne that would afford Joy, when God's Heart did burn with wrath, and his Face was clouded with Anger. He could not content or ſatisfy himſelf with the joy of Riches, ſenſual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, or Worldly Honour; ſuch joy did not go deep, would not ſtay, or laſt long. It was nothing but the joy of God's Salvation, that could ſatisfy him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>We will be glad and rejoyce in thy Salvation. Heſter</hi> could take no Pleaſure in her Honour, in her Palace, in all her outward En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, when the Decree was paſſed to deſtroy her and her People, <hi>Eſther</hi> 7.3, 4. If Sin reign in you, Eternal Death muſt reign over you, and the wrath of God abide on you. What outward thing can comfort, relieve
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41823:39"/>or revive you? Will it chear a Man condemned to Death, to tell him you will give him one ſweet Draught of Wine, one good Meals Meat before he be Executed.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. You cannot dwell ſafely, if you are not ſaved. In the Text it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that thoſe that are ſaved ſhall dwell ſafely; and indeed, no others can dwell ſafe from the fear of Evil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. laſt. Thoſe that are in their Sins, and under Guilt, may fear ſtill to be arreſted by God their great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, and to be arraigned before him as their Sovereign Judge. The dread of the Firſt and Second Death may torment them, an d hold them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually under grievous Bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. Your Tabernacles (Sinners) will moulder down; your Earthly Comforts will melt away; your Stewardſhips will be taken from you; God will change your Countenances, and ſend you away into a miſerable Eternity, into a dark and doleful Priſon. You are Tenants at God's Will, you are not ſure of one Days continuance in the World; God may quickly require, and take away your
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41823:39"/>Souls. If <hi>David</hi> panted and longed ſo much for a ſhort Temporal Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81, 82. how much more ſhould we long for a Spiritual and Eternal Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. laſt. We ſo need this Salvation, that it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for us, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. We muſt be ſaved, we can have no Pardon, but from the God of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14. and we can receive no Bleſſing but from the God of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.10. We muſt ſee God's Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. laſt, or our own Deſtruction, <hi>Job</hi> 21.20. If we cannot commit our Spirits into the Hand of God as a Redeemer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. we muſt fall into his Hand as a Judge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. No outward Enjoyments here, can either be ſafe for us, or ſweet to us, if they flow not from the God of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>God doth afford us a Day of Salvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. this is cauſed by the Day Spring from on high, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.78. by the exerciſe of Chriſt's Prophetical Office, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.22. <hi>John</hi> 17.6.20. He declares the Father's Name to us; he teaches us, that God hath choſen and appointed ſome to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41823:40"/>Salvation, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. that he hath prepared Salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.29, 30, by anointing, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son to obey, ſuffer and ſatisfy. God hath raiſed up this Horn of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.69. he hath perfected the Captain and Author of Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. As Chriſt is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9. ſo he is in a fit and full capacity to ſave others. The word of Salvation is ſent to us, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.26. The Goſpel of Salvation is a Supernatural Doctrine, we ſhould have been utterly ignorant of it, if God had not ſent it to us. What Grace is this, that the word of Salvation ſhould be ſent to us, that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed our ſelves, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. that were ſo blind, that we did not ſeek after God, and ſo vile and filthy, that God might for ever have ceaſed to ſeek after us, that are without ſtrength to help our ſelves, and yet are ungodly, and ſo do provoke God never to help us, or favour us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.8. That it ſhould be ſent to us, that did not ſeek after, or ſend for it. Light came, it was not ſent for, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. O that God ſhould ſend it to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41823:40"/>us, and not to ſo many other Nations in the World; they hear not the Trumpet of the Jubilee, the Call of the Shepheard, the Voice of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. O ſhall the Spirit ſtrive with us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. and Chriſt's Servants endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to compel us, by Earneſt Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Importunity, and yet ſhall all this be in vain; will you not believe their Report, or come to Chriſt for Life? Shall a Treaty of Peace, end in an Eternal War, and a day of Salvation iſſue in your everlaſting Deſtruction. Salvation is brought near to you, and placed in <hi>Zion,</hi> and will you put the word of Salvation away from you, and thereby judge your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Everlaſting Life, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.16. The Cord of a Promiſe is let down into our Dungeon; Chriſt's Chariot comes among us, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.9, 40. He comes near to us, preaching Peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. He knocks at our Doors, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You cannot eſcape, if you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. There is no other Phyſitian to heal you, no other Redeemer but Chriſt to ſet you free, no other Fountain in which you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41823:41"/>may waſh; no other Foundation on which you may build; no other Wing, Shadow, or City of Refuge to ſecure you. God will not ſuffer your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Chriſt, and neglect of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to go unpuniſhed. God will wound the Head of ſuch as go on in their Treſpaſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.21. Chriſt's Hand will find out all his Enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.4. thoſe that turn away from Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. ſhall certainly be turned into Hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. God bringeth near his Salvation, offers it, and promiſes it to all that will look to Jeſus Chriſt for it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. Thoſe therefore are worthy to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that turn away from Chriſt, and deſpiſe his Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider there is but a Remnant that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. few that will walk in the narrow way, that find the ſtrait Gate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13, 14. And thoſe that are ſaved, will be ſaved with a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. The Righteous are ſcarcely ſaved, they muſt bear the Croſs, endure many Tribulations, have frequent Combats and Conflicts, and continual Warfare with Spiritual
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41823:41"/>Enemies: They muſt run with the greateſt ſpeed, fight with the greateſt zeal againſt Sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26. They have a Civil War with Luſts within, a Foreign War with the World and Satan without.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider what a great Mercy it is to obtain this Salvation; it is a moſt valuable Grace, for God to chooſe and appoint any to Salvation, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. when he might have appointed all to periſh, and left them to Deſtruction. O what a Mercy is this, for God to pluck out of a periſhing World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. to fiſh out of a dead Sea; to cut off from a corrupt Stock; to call out of an infected Houſe, and a barren Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Church repreſents, it as a rich Stream of Mercy, and ſpring of Joy, to be cloathed with Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. This is a great Mercy, for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such are armed againſt Spiritual Conflicts, that have for a Helmet, the Hope of Salvation, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 6.17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. This may guard their Heads from all anxious, perplexing Thoughts about their Eternal State.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41823:42"/>Hope is an Anchor caſt within the Vale; as ſoon as they ſet out, and begin their Voyage, they may caſt their Anchor into their Port and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo have their Hearts eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe that have hope of this Salvation, are ſupported under Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Perſecutions, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 18.9. <hi>Partake thou of the Afflictions of the Goſpel, according to the power of God, who both ſaved us, and called us.</hi> As if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, Murmure not at, faint not under the Afflictions of the Goſpel, for God hath ſaved you from the greateſt Enemies, and from the worſt Evils, and all your Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſhall turn to your Salvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. They ſhall further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, promote it; they ſhall refine Saints from their Droſs, wean them from their ſtrange Land, and cauſe them to long more after their Father's Houſe, and Heavenly Country. Have they any Reaſon to be diſcontented, whom God loves, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.59. and that are Heirs of Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. and of the Kingdom. <hi>James</hi> 2.5.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41823:42"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe may die with comfort; they have hope in Death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32. That which doth ſhipwrack o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhall land them ſafe on the calm Shores of a Bleſſed Eternity; that which impoveriſhes others, ſhall enrich them. Though Death doth pluck off the Rags of Mortality, yet God ſhall cloath them with Robes of Glory: When their Bodies drop down into the Pit, their Souls ſhall be taken up into the Palace; when their Fleſh feeds Worms, their Spirits ſhall feaſt with Saints, and Angels; though God doth kill them, yet they may truſt he will be their Salvation, <hi>Joh</hi> 13.15, 16. When the Eye of Senſe ſhall be ſhut, ſo that Saints ſhall no more ſee Worldly Objects, yet then God will ſhew them his Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. laſt. They ſhall ſee God's Salvation, from Sins Temptations, Troubles, Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; they ſhall ſee a freedom from Spiritual and Temporal Evils, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be tranſlated into an Eternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Chriſt will receive their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Souls, and be their Guardian and Truſtee till the Reſurrection. O it is ſweet, when God adds to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41823:43"/>Mercies of Sixty, Seventy, Eighty Years, the enjoyment of a bleſſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. It is Salvation that muſt crown Old Age with Glory; Death is the critical time, the Soul muſt then ſee Life or Death; a Heaven muſt ſhine from God's pleaſing Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or Hell be rained from his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Face. O how ſweet is it then to ſee the truth of God's Promiſes, in the enjoyment of an Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe intereſted in this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be ſaved in the Day of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. when Sins will find out others, and Vengeance will take hold of them, then Believers ſhall be ſaved. O what unexpreſſible comfort will it be, to point out Jeſus Chriſt at the Great Day, and to ſay, This is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us, and we will be glad, and rejoyce in his Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. This is a Salvation that will for ever ſet Souls beyond Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, out of the reach of all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Evils, Enemies: They ſhall then fully receive the end of their Faith, even an Eternal Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41823:43"/>Chriſt will appear unto Salvation, to thoſe that look for him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. laſt. Then Saints ſhall be Heirs in full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. They ſhall be redeemed from all Evils, or poſſeſſed of all goodneſs, be exalted to the Kingdoms, and be placed in the Throne.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall laſtly give you ſome Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions how you may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You muſt be enlightned and convinced of your Danger; you muſt ſee the Evils you are under, and the Danger and Deſtruction you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to. Few do think themſelves to be condemned to Death, and to be ſick unto Death. That they are Children of Satan, and Enemies to God. They will not believe that they are captivated by the Devil, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved by Sin, and chained to the World. The Scripture teaches us, that Men are held, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. and that they are led, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. they are held in the Snares of Sin, and led by Satan: Their Luſts are Bonds, their depraved Wills and corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are the Chains that the Devil
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41823:44"/>leads them by. Men diſcourſe, ſee or diſcern what are the true Evils that they ſhould be ſaved from; they are not ſenſible of the blindneſs and vanity of their Minds, the deceit and deſperate wickedneſs of their Hearts; That their Wills are perverſe and rebellious, and the greateſt Enemies to God and their own Souls. They will account that Troubles, Afflictions, Reproaches, Wants and Death, are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, but they do not perceive that their greateſt Evils, and worſt Enemies are within themſelves. A Root of Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, an evil Treaſure, a Body of Death, a Fountain of Iniquity, that is in their Souls. But Sinners muſt know what firſt cleaves to them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in them, do defile and deform their Souls, and teſtify againſt them before God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.12. <hi>Our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are with us, and as for our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities we know them.</hi> Yea, Men have no liking of that which is the true Salvation. Saints are ſaid to love God's Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 70.4. but a Carnal Creature doth not love, but loath God's Salvation; to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his falſe Notions, his vain
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41823:44"/>Thoughts, his corrupt Opinions, his inordinate love of himſelf, and of the Creatures, to be taken off from his ſenſual Pleaſures, carnal Delights, to be brought to give his Heart to God, ſet his Love on Chriſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Spiritual, Future, Inviſible things; this is a Salvation he dreads and hates, and if he could go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with this vain Mind, and carnal Heart, it would be a place of Exile, and of Puniſhment to him.</p>
                  <p>You muſt ſee your Danger; that you are as <hi>Iſaac</hi> bound, laid on the Altar, and ready to be ſacrificed, as a whole Burnt-Offering, in the Flames of Wrath. You muſt hear the juſt, dreadful Sentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.25. <hi>The Lord commanded the Debtor to be ſold, and Payment to be made.</hi> It is dreadful to be ſold into the Priſon, into a Place of Eternal Bondage. Your Heart muſt be broken, your Spirit wounded, your Soul burdened under the ſenſe of the guilt and filth of Sin, elſe you will not have a due value of the Doctrine and Promiſe of Salvation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. We muſt account it worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, more valuable than all the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41823:45"/>Riches, Pleaſures, Honours of the World. If a Man were ſinking, and drowning, he would not regard a Bag of Gold, or a Box of Diamonds, but prefer a Cord caſt out to ſave him, a Boat to take him in, more than all the things of the World. Believe that your Condition is exceeding bad and dangerous. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife looked back, as one that doubted whether <hi>Sodom</hi> would be deſtroyed; and <hi>Lots</hi> Sons in Law, could not believe that the danger of <hi>Sodom</hi> was ſo great, and its Deſtruction ſo near, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.14. So Sinners believe not, that to be Carnally minded is Death; that they that live after the Fleſh, ſhall die; that they that are far off from God ſhall periſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27. They that go a whoring from God, ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider what is the great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, the grand obſtruction of your Salvation: Whether ſome Sin is not ſo ſweet, ſome Luſt ſo pleaſant and delightful, that you will rather ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a miſerable Eternity, than part with it? What is it that holds you? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. And what is it that you
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41823:45"/>hold faſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5. There is ſome Adulterous League between you and your Luſts, between your Hearts and the Creatures, that hinders a lawful Marriage with Jeſus Chriſt, and an intereſt in his Salvation. Do you not delight in ſome Abomination, and therefore are unwilling to be made clean, and ſet free from it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt fly to Chriſt, enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Ark, get into this City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. Men are ſaid to be ſaved in the Lord, with an everlaſting Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.17. We muſt look to Chriſt for Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. Come to him for Life, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. There is a believing to Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. laſt. Salvation is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. Redemption is in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. and everlaſting Life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. Truſt on Chriſt, and not on the pieces of the Shipwrack, as they <hi>Acts</hi> 27. laſt. Some have Civility, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a little Form of Religion; all theſe are but the broken Planks of our old Shipwrackt ſtate; do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake a Truce for a Peace, Embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Quickening; it is Chriſt only that can be our Salvation, and our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41823:46"/>Life. We muſt ſee the Son, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31, that we may ſee Salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.6. Though <hi>Noah</hi> was a Righteous Man, yet he muſt leave his own Home, and enter into the Ark, that he might be ſaved from the Flood. So thoſe that have moſt of an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteouſneſs, muſt not ſtay at Home, nor truſt in themſelves, but fly to Chriſt, the Ark of Salvation, that they may be deliver'd from an Eternal Storm of Fire and Brimſtone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt repent unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. waſh our Hearts from wickedneſs, that we may be ſaved, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. We cannot fly from wrath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7. If we do not eſcape that Corruption that is in the World through Luſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. how can we drink Spiritual Poyſon, wallow in our Mires, ſerve thoſe Luſts that war againſt our Souls, and yet be ſaved? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. We muſt crucify the Fleſh, with its Affections and Luſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. It is theſe hurtful Luſts that do drown Men in Perdition and Deſtruction, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. How
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41823:46"/>can we be ſaved, and yet retain that which keeps open the Breach, keeps up the enmity between God and us. Luſts do war againſt our Souls in good earneſt, and we muſt not be in jeſt with Sin, or fight as thoſe that beat the Air, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt work out our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Fear and Trembling, 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 12, 13. We muſt work upon and about our Salvation, we muſt work more to perfect it; there are things lacking in our Faith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. We are defective in our Love and Holineſs; we muſt nor think we are rich enough, are ſaved enough, live enough; we muſt not ſet any limits to Chriſt's Kingdom, or bounds to our growth; God bids us open our Mouth wide, that he may fill it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.10, 11. Chriſt came, that his Sheep might have Life, and have it more abundantly, <hi>John</hi> 10.10. Saints ſhould daily be drawing Spiritual Waters at the Wells of Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.3. We muſt draw, or elſe be dry; we muſt draw, or elſe decay and decline, run behind hand, and become poor: What pains did <hi>Noah</hi> take, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41823:47"/>for, and building of the Ark, and yet this was but the means of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Salvation. <hi>Noah</hi> was probably longer in building the Ark, then we do live bere in the World; and he did not give over, till he had wrought out, and finiſhed this Veſſel for his Temporal Salvation; and ſhall we not all our Life long, be working out, and perfecting our Spiritual Salvation. O tremble to neglect any means of Salvation, or to uſe them ſlightly. It is God that works in us both to will and do of his own meer good pleaſure; therefore we muſt not diſpleaſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front or provoke him by our Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Slightneſs. This is the great end, and the proper improvement of God's long-ſuffering, to account it Salvation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. that God ſpares us not that we might riſe to Honour, gather Wealth, drink in ſenſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delight, but that we might mind and purſue an Everlaſting Salvation. As God exerciſed long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering towards the Old World, while the Ark was building, 1 <hi>Pel.</hi> 3.20. ſo God lengthens out his Patience, while the Elect are building up themſelves on their moſt holy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41823:47"/>Faith, and are perfecting Holineſs, in the fear of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more renewed in the Spirit of your Minds, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23. Let the word of God root deeper, and let the Temple of God riſe higher in you. Let your Weeds be more rooted out, your Filthineſs be more purged away, your Droſs be more burnt up; take heed of minding of, and doting on Earthly things, and of forgetting, and neglecting your Eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We ſhould order our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aright, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. laſt, walk with God, walk worthy of God, to all well-pleaſing, 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 10.11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. We muſt keep the way of Salvation, walk in the path of Life, and in the way everlaſting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 159. laſt. If we are guided by God's Counſel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. and led by his Spirit, we ſhall be certainly received to his Glory.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We ſhould often conſider, that our Salvation draws every Day nearer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11.12. We advance in our Race, we draw nearer to the Mark, and Prize; and this ſhould mightily quicken and influence our Souls. O think often of this, that you are near the end of Time, the Borders and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41823:48"/>Confines of Eternity; you draw nearer to the glorious Preſence of God, and to an immediate and full Communion with him. Should you flag or faint near the end of your Race; ſhould you grow drowſy, and ſleep at the Door of your Father's Houſe, near the Borders of <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi>'s Land? O, how ſhould you rouſe up your ſelves, and conſider you will ſoon be gone from the Lion's Den, and Mountains of Leopards? You will get out of this Barren Wilderneſs, into the delicious pleaſant <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is above. Salvation is ready to be revealed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. a full, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Salvation. Chriſt will come as a Saviour from Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. His Life ſhall then perfectly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the Soul, and his Image be impreſſed on the Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.48. Then you will be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his likeneſs, and be fitted to have an immediate and everlaſting Communion with him. O think upon, and make ſure your Intereſt in this Salvation; you will looſe the greateſt good, and ſuffer the worſt Evil, if you come ſhort of this Salvation.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41823:48"/>Conſider whether you have the things that accompany Salvation, <hi>Heb,</hi> 6.9. Have you the Graces that are joined with a ſtate of Salvation? Have you Faith of God's working, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. Hope of God's begetting, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. Love of God's kindling, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. Have you Evidence that you are redeemed, that is, bought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. in that your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity is turned, and that you are brought again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.8. Hath God ſaved you? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. Is God's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in a conſiderable degree com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to you, and executed in you? God's Gifts and Calling are without Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. Thoſe that God hath begun to ſave in Time, he will not deſtroy to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

                  <p>IN the former part of the Verſe, we are informed what the Meſſiah ſhould do; that <hi>in his Days</hi> Judah <hi>ſhould be ſaved, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhould dwell ſafely.</hi> In the latter Words, we are inſtructed how he ſhould effect this; <hi>This is the Name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> Salvation
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41823:50"/>and Righteouſneſs are often joyned together in the Scripture, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9. <hi>He is Juſt, and having Salvation. My Righteouſneſs is near, my Salvation is gone forth,</hi> Iſa. 51.5. <hi>I bring near my Righteouſneſs, it ſhall not be far off, and my Salvation ſhall not tarry,</hi> Iſa. 56.13. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Goſpel is the power of God to Salvation,</hi> becauſe in it the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God is Revealed, 1 <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, 17. The Goſpel could not offer and promiſe Salvation, if it did not reveal Righteouſneſs. God will not exalt Mercy, and debaſe and wrong Juſtice. God will ſave in a way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of himſelf, and that ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently redound to his Glory; as he will magnify Grace, ſo he will exalt Juſtice; as Love ſhall ſhine, and Grace reign, ſo God's Holineſs ſhall be crowned, his Law magnified, the truth of his Threatning be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. He that is the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and gift of God's Love, ſhall alſo be the moſt Terrible Example of his Revenging Juſtice and Severity. In the Words, we may obſerve, 1. That a Name ſhould be given to, and put on the <hi>Meſſiah; This is the Name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41823:50"/>he ſhall be called.</hi> 2. What this Name is, he ſhall be called <hi>Jehovah, our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is intimated, that a Name ſhould be given to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> God delights in the Scripture, to give ſeveral Names to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To deſcribe, and ſet forth the greatneſs of his Perſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive, and bare a Son, and ſhall call his Name</hi> Immanuel, <hi>which ſignifies, God with us.</hi> God and Man were at the greateſt diſtance and enmity with each other. What a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing then is expreſſed in this Name, that God is with us, in our Nature, made Man, and manifeſted in our Fleſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. He thus came down to us, to raiſe us up to himſelf. He apprehended our Nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. that he might apprehend our Perſons, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. and eſpouſe them to himſelf, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. There is a wonderful Marriage of the Divine and Humane Nature in one Perſon, that the Son of God and Believers might be joined together in one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23.29, 30. An other
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41823:51"/>Name of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is mentioned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a Son is given, he ſhall be called the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Here weak Fleſh, and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, Time and Eternity, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of Days, and the Ancient of Days, a Child lately born, and the Everlaſting Father, meet in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Though the Humane Nature did cloud and eclipſe, yet it did not aboliſh, or extinguiſh the Majeſty and glory of the Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God gives the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> a Name that points at, and ſets out his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; <hi>He ſhall be called, the wonderful Counſellor, the Prince of Peace.</hi> Surely, he is a moſt excellent and wonderful Counſellor, that can direct and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, how Enemies may be reconciled, Priſoners be enlarged, Captives be releaſed, languiſhing, dying Souls may be healed; thoſe that are loſt and entangled in a woful Wilderneſs, may get into the right way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Favour and Family of God, and Strangers may be adopted by, and related to God; and he is an Admirable Prince, that can ſpeak
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41823:51"/>Peace to Enemies, and give Happineſs to the Miſerable, that ſhall quiet and ſatisfy their Souls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God gives Chriſt a Name, that ſignifies his new Relation to a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed; <hi>He ſhall be called the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt upwards, ſo he is the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Son; but if we meditate on him downwards, ſo he is the Everlaſting Father: He propagates his new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he raiſes up an Holy Off-spring, he begets Sons and Daughters to God, as a Second <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe the new Nature ſhall never periſh, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life ſhall never be extinguiſhed. Chriſt may well be ſtiled an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father; the Seed of the new Creature is incorruptible, it lives and abides for ever, in that holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſprings from it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the Words of the Text, it is ſaid, <hi>that the Branch raiſed up to</hi> David <hi>ſhould be called</hi> Jehovah, <hi>our Righteouſneſs.</hi> A Branch ſhould be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and ſo ſhould work out Righteouſneſs for us, and derive it to us. This is indeed a wonderful Name
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41823:52"/>given to the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and Three things are implied in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our Righteouſneſs is not in our ſelves, but without us; it is a Robe put upon us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10. <hi>He hath covered me with the Robe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of God is ſaid to be upon all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. How falſe then is that Name, that <hi>Medina</hi> on <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> in <hi>Prim. Secund. Queſt.</hi> 113. <hi>Artic.</hi> 21. by the way of Contempt doth put on the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, extrinſicarii Haeretici,</hi> that is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks that aſſert an outward Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, imputed for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Text proves and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that Chriſt is our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that his Obedience is the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Righteouſneſs, and his Attoning Sacrifice, the Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification. God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts us in Chriſt the well-beloved, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. We are bleſſed in him that endured the Curſe; and are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given for his ſake, who was made Sin, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. laſt. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41823:52"/>the efficient cauſe of our Sin, but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is the formal cauſe of our Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This truth the Text doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare and hold out, that this Righteouſneſs of Jehovah, muſt be made ours, we muſt be intereſted in it, we muſt be inveſted with it; elſe <hi>Jehovah</hi> cannot be ſtiled <hi>our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> And how can this be, but by a Donation and Imputation of this Righteouſneſs to us? God that made Chriſt Sin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. doth alſo make him Righteouſneſs to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. We muſt believe into Chriſt, and ſo believe unto Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How ſweetly do thoſe Phraſes anſwer, he that believes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, on, and into the Son, <hi>John</hi> 3. laſt, with his Heart, he believes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. unto, or into Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall a little further conſider of, inſiſt on, and explain this Name of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a new Name that <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son aſſumes; if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, broken the Command, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41823:53"/>the Image, extinguiſhed the Life of God in his Soul, there had been no need that the Son of God ſhould have aſſumed this Name. It doth not ſuit the ſtate of Man ſtanding, but the condition of Man fallen, and that in order to recover and raiſe him up. If the Law of God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained written, Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs had countinued flouriſhing in our Souls; we ſhould have been ſtiled the Friends of God, and have needed no attoning Sacrifice to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God. But now we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and void of Righteouſneſs, and ſo do need that <hi>Jehovah</hi> should take this Name, and become our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. It may be enquired whether Chriſt doth not point at this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when he promiſes to write his new Name on victorious Believers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. That this Name shall be openly legible and viſible on them, and that they shall have the honour and benefit of it to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is a Name proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son, and cannot be extended or communicated to the Father, or Spirit. The Father is ſaid
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41823:53"/>to beget us again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. And to create us after his own Image, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. And we are ſaid to be born of, and ſanctified by the Spirit, <hi>John.</hi> 3.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. But yet neither the Father, nor the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are ſaid to be our Righteouſneſs. Our Saviour Chriſt is both the ſole Worker, and Subject of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs whereby we are Juſtified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is a Myſterious Name; it is asked by <hi>Agur,</hi> who knows the Name of God's Son, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ſhould never have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this ſecret Name of the Son, mentioned in the Text, if the Scripture had not revealed it to us: The Righteouſneſs of God for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is a great and deep Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, moſt Remote from the Sentiments of the Natural Man; and if Chriſt had hid it in his heart, we ſhould for ever have been ignorant of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.9, 10. The Son that wrought it, doth alſo declare and Preach it to the World. Would it not have looked like an unreaſonable Preſumption, and have been reputed intollerable Pride, for us to call <hi>Jehovah</hi> our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41823:54"/>Could we ever have aſpired to, or hoped for ſuch a thing, had not the Scripture given Chriſt this Name, and taught us this Doctrine? What an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Myſtery is this, that when the Law of God requires us to work out a perfect Righteouſneſs, and perform a compleat Obedience for our own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, that now the Son of God himſelf hath wrought, and brought this Righteouſneſs, that he that might have exacted Righteouſneſs of us, ſhould give Righteouſneſs to us; that he, who, as a Law-giver, obliges us to a full Conformity to his own Law, ſhould become a Subject to his Father, and a Servant to his own Law? O! how ſurprizing is this, that he who Teaches us Duty, ſhould himſelf learn Obedience? <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. and become obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Death, even the death of the Croſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.8. If Chriſt had not been made under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. he could not have been made Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is a moſt Honourable Name to Chriſt; this is promiſed both as an Honour, and as a Reward to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> that he ſhould juſtifie many,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41823:54"/>
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11. How glorious is this to Chriſt, that he is the Righteouſneſs of the whole Church: that he provides a Garment wide, large, and long enough to cloath his whole Body? He appears in a Garment down to the Foot, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.13. that can cover and adorn all his Members. Though he be but one Man, yet many may be juſtified by his Obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. Though he be but one Sacrifice, yet his Blood is ſhed for many, for the Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. As the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> could defile thouſands more, if the World ſhould ſo long continue; ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> could juſtifie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more if they did fly to him, and truſt on him. God is as well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if the Curſe had been executed on them that believe, and they are as ſafe, as if the Law of God had been Abrogated for them. Believers are clothed with change of Rayment, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.4. This one Garment is ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led change of Rayment; it is as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to Clothe, and adorn us, as if every time we contracted New Guilt or Spotted our ſelves, we were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a new Garment: this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41823:55"/>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the only Righteouſneſs of Men for Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſince their Fall; It is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. The Glory of it never fades, the Virtue of it is never Exhauſted; it is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that hath laſted through all Ages, and will be effectual to the end of the World: It is ſo large a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſo rich an Inheritance, that, as <hi>Noah</hi> was, ſo all Believers may be Heirs of the Righteouſneſs that is by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. and this is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Chriſt, that he hath ſo filled up the Breach by his own dead Body, and made it ſtronger, than if the Wall of our Innoceny had never been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Name of the Son of God is moſt comfortable to us; How wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is our Natural State? there is none in it Righteous, no not one; none that doth good, no not one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 11. All are under fin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. They have failed in the Race of Obedience, and are fallen ſhort of the Prize of Glory. And O how Refreſhing and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41823:55"/>Reviving is this, to hear that the Son of God brings near his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 46.12. The World is a Sea of Wickedneſs, an Ocean of Impiety; Where could Righteouſneſs be found, or how could it be attained? But this is a moſt ſurprizing and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth, that the Son of God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate ſhould be an Iſle of Innocency, and Righteouſneſs, ſtanding up in the midſt of a Sea of Corruption. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> in one of his Orations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Providence,</hi> obſerves this as a wonderful Work of God, to Create Iſles, as ſo many Inns in the Sea, for Ships to apply themſelves to, reſt in, and receive neceſſary ſupplies from: But this is more Grace and Mercy, that we that are void of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, laden with Iniquity, and ready to ſink into the Deep and Bottomleſs Sea of the Wrath of God, may, by Faith, ſaile and ſwim to this bleſſed Iſle of Righteouſneſs the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and there find reſt and ſafety, from the Toſſing and Threatning Waves of Divine Diſpleaſure: It is dreadful for ſin to be always and ever before the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.14, 15.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41823:56"/>but it is moſt ſweet and comfortable for Chriſt's Blood to be ſprinkled on the Thrones, and to be always before the eye of God: We were in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and horrour, and ready to ſink under deſperation, and then doth this Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his wings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. his glorious beams do ſcatter the thick and black clouds of our Iniquities, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.22. Sin did reign ſo, as to bring us under the guilt of Eternal Death: But how comfortable is it that Reigning Grace ſhould ſucceed Reigning Sin. Revenging Juſtice might next follow after Reigning Sin, but it is Grace that now reigns, through the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> unto Eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. Our Iniquities were as deep Waters gone over our heads, there was no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through them: they were a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden, too heavy for us to bear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. they were ready to ſink us down into the deep Sea of the wrath of God, but in this Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jehovah</hi> we may be lifted up, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.16. As <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> once gave himſelf a Sacrifice of a ſweet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41823:56"/>ſmelling ſavour unto God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. to God the Father continually gives Chriſt moſt precious and fragrant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe on the account of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Sufferings always, to plead before the Father, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. much Incenſe is ſaid there to be given him to offer with the Prayers of all Saints; Chriſt's Obedience and Sacrifice makes an everlaſting Perfume in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sanctuary. It is ſaid of the Gentiles, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap>, They earneſtly catched at they greedily laid hold of, they ſtrongly graſped the Righteouſneſs that is by Faith. This is the only Cord caſt out to us ſinking, and drowning Sinners, which we ſhould catch hold of, to keep us from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This Name of Chriſt ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, laſt, be victorious in the World over all the Reproaches, Slanders, and Defamations caſt on Chriſt: the blind Malignant World called Chriſt a Glutton, a Wine Bibber, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.19. they charged him as a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>John</hi> 10.33, 36. becauſe he ſaid
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41823:57"/>he was the Son of God, and ſo made himſelf equal with God, <hi>John</hi> 10.33. they ſtiled him a deceiver, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.63. The <hi>Jews</hi> did black Chriſt all that they could, they raiſed Miſts, yea thick Clouds, to obſcure and hide his Glory, yet all this ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: this Illuſtrious Name of Chriſt ſhould wade out of all theſe Ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſcatter all theſe Clouds. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the endeavours of the World to obſtruct his Honour, and cloath him with ſhame, yet he ſhould by Multitudes, in all Ages, be owned, acknowledged, and called <hi>Jehovah our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. This Evidences that the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power of God did go along with the Goſpel of Chriſt; that though the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day do ſtile him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:41823:57"/>
                  <p>I ſhall obſerve, and inſiſt on this Doctrine foom theſe latter words of the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is, and ſhall be called, <hi>Jehovah our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet, in the Name of the Lord, promiſes, That the Lord would raiſe up to <hi>David</hi> a Righteous Branch, one that ſhould be moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Juſt in his Humane Nature; and that this Righteous <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſprung from <hi>David,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh, ſhould be called, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, our Righteouſneſs:</hi> this inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates he ſhould be Man and <hi>Jehovah</hi> too in one Perſon, and as ſuch he ſhould be owned and acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>Four things are to be ſpoken to for the proſecution of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> What Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> the Son is here meant, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> To Evidence and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> God-Man, is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41823:58"/>our Righteouſneſs, yea, our only Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> How this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is made ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Who they are that ſhall call Chriſt by this Name, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jehovah</hi> is here meant.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſhall Anſwer;</p>
                  <p>Firſt. <hi>Negatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly. <hi>Affirmatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, I Anſwer <hi>Negatively;</hi> It is not the Eſſential Eternal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Son of God, as <hi>Oſiander</hi> the <hi>Lutheran</hi> affirmed; but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. This Righteouſneſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, it is proper to the Divine Nature, and cannot paſs, or be derived to a creature: To ſay, that this Righteouſneſs is given to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41823:58"/>is to deifie them, rather than to juſtifie them; that is moſt certain, that in this ſence, God will not give his Glory to another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Righteouſneſs is an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; contrary to us, at Hoſtility with us: God, according to it, hates the Wicked, and abhors the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5. He is a ſwift Witneſs againſt them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. A Terrible Judge to them, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Fire in the execution of his Vengeance on them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.24. As God is Holy, he lothes unclean Souls; and, as he is Juſt, he hates guilty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If another Righteouſneſs had not been found out, God would riſe up againſt them as an Enemy, and break out on them for their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. I Anſwer <hi>Affirmatively.</hi> This Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jehovah</hi> is not a Righteouſneſs poſſeſſed by the Son from Eternity, but acquired in time. It is not the Righteouſneſs that was his Patrimony, as a Son, but his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, as a Servant, by the ſweat of his Brows, by the travel of his Soul, by the effuſion of his Blood, by the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41823:59"/>expenſe of his Life. This was wrought by the Son of God Incarnate, by the Mediator in the form of a Servant, as <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Type of Chriſt, is called the Miniſter, or Servant of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11. So <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> was made under the Law, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.4. It is ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11. <hi>By his Knowledge ſhall my righteous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant juſtifie many.</hi> This is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, God himſelf aſſerts, <hi>That by his knowledge his righteous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhould juſtifie many;</hi> and that by virtue of his ſervice, in bearing the Iniquities of his People. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did exactly perform what as a Servant he had undertaken, and ſo he was Righteous. Here we may obſerve a wonderful Myſtery, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>our Righteouſneſs;</hi> yet God's righteous Servant alſo is ſaid to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Theſe two things ſweetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire in our Juſtification. God's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant did perform Obedience, and ſuffer on the Croſs. He that took our Nature, and was a Servant in it, was only capable of doing, and dying for us: As Man, he muſt be ſubject, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41823:59"/>ſuffer; but yet as he is alſo <hi>Jehovah</hi> he gives an infinite Price, and vallue to his Obedience and Sufferings. The ſame Perſon was God-Man: as Man he ſerved, and performed the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by which we are juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. but as God he gives an infinite worth to his own Service: So both <hi>Jehovah</hi> is our Righteouſneſs, and yet God's Righteous Servant doth alſo Juſtifie. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Two things;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> In his Obedience to the Commands of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> In his Subjection to, and enduring of the Curſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> took <hi>debitum officii,</hi> the debt of Duty, as well as <hi>debitum poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> the dept of Puniſhment. And ſuitably unto this object of our Faith is thus expreſſed; 1. Our Faith is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the Righteouſneſs of God, ſo the word might be render'd; and this Phraſe, <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> ſeems to be taken, and be proved from my Text,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41823:60"/>
                     <hi>Jehovah our Righteouſneſs.</hi> 2. Faith is ſaid to be in the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth for a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood.</hi> All the Garments of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are ſaid to ſmell of Myrrh, Aloes and Caſſia, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. As <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Garments are expounded to be his Graces, ſo they may alſo be interpreted to be the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that flow from thoſe Graces. Garments ſignifie Actions, ſo it is ſaid, they waſhed their Robes white in the Blood of the the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. So theſe Garments point out the Active Obedience of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> It is ſaid alſo, That <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf an offering, and a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. <hi>Zanchy</hi> on the place, obſerves the Emphaſis of the Apoſtles words; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be firſt an Offering, and then a Sacrifice. There were Offerings of Firſt-fruits, and Fine Flower, and of ſuch things as had not life, but living creatures were offered up in Sacrifice, and then their blood was ſpilt, and their lives taken away. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Offering, may point out the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41823:60"/>Holineſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Life, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sacrifice, did ſignifie his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and his Death. How ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and refreſhing is it to us, to Read and Hear of the ſweet ſmelling Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sacrifice of our Lord <hi>Jeſus?</hi> It was foretold of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that his Ears, both his Ears, ſhould be opened, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. one Ear was opened, as he was Man, to hear, and obey the Commands of the Moral Law; and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s other Ear was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, to liſten to, and comply with that peculiar Commandment that was given to him.</p>
                  <p>As Mediator, to lay down his Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. Innocent Man owed but a ſingle debt to God, and that was O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Law: but Fallen and Guilty Man is bound to God in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bond. He owes God Obedience, as he is a Creature; and he owes God Glory to be raiſed out of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Miſery and Torments, as he is a Guilty Creature. Therefore Sins are called Debts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12. becauſe the Tranſgreſſors of the Law, for Non-payment of the Debt of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41823:61"/>contract another, and New Debt, and that is an Obligation to endure Puniſhment. As they wrong, and rob God by their ſins of Omiſſion, and Commiſſion, ſo they are bound to make Reſtitution to God by their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Sufferings, and Torments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was to Glorifie God in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Creature, in the Form of a Servant: he was to be a perfect Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Piety, and an example of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs on Earth, where there had not been a full and exact Inſtance of Righteouſneſs, and Obedience fince the Fall, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt Man on earth, that lives and ſins not. The Earth hath been full of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and wickedneſs before God, Gen.</hi> 6.13. How much was it then for the Glory of God, and the Honour of his Law, that there ſhould be a Man Perfectly Holy, and Juſt on Earth? A Virgin-Soul among Whores and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſſes? A Diligent Servant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Drones, and Lazy Loiterers?
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41823:61"/>A Loyal Subject among Rebels, and Enemies? How little Honour had been given to the Law, if only the Penalty of it had been inflicted, and its Curſe been executed; but the Commands of it had never been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and fulfilled? Is it for the Credit, or Glory of an Earthly Prince, to have no Obedience paid to his Laws, but only the Penalties annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them to take hold of, and be executed on all that are under his Juriſdiction? And ſhall God's Laws never be obeyed? Shall the Penalties of them only be executed? As a Foreign Prince, if he Travels through the Territories, and Dominions of another King, doth owe him a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Allegiance, and muſt needs be ſubject to his Laws; ſo the Son of God (though he was a Rightful and a Glorious King) yet Travelling through the Dominions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the nature of a Creature, to Redeem Captives, muſt needs be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Laws that God gave to all Mankind. The High-Prieſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Type of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he was bound
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41823:62"/>to wear a Plate of Gold joyned to his Mitre on his Forehead, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.36, 37, 38. This did intimate, and teach us, that the true ſubſtantial High-Prieſt was to be Perfectly holy and abſolutely devoted to God. Tho' God may ſpy Faults, and obſerve Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and Spots in the beſt of Saints; yet he may look to the Forehead of <hi>Jeſus</hi> our Great High-Prieſt, and there read nothing but Holineſs to the Lord. The Law of God was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly impreſſed on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Heart, and fully expreſſed in his Life. He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God to the Height of utmoſt Perfection. He loved Men, even his own, that were in the World, with the moſt pure, ardent, and intenſe Love, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. he was ſo intent, ſo fixed in Exalting, and Magnifying God, that when his Soul was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the proſpect of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet he Pray'd thus, <hi>Father, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy own Name,</hi> John. 12.27, 28, 29. As if he ſhould ſay, However I am clouded and eclipſed; whatever bitter Cup I drink; whatever heavy Burden I bear; yet, <hi>Father, glorifie thy own Name.</hi> As the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41823:62"/>us by his Self-ſeeking; ſo the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> raiſed, and Recovered us by his Self-denyal; and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Love to his People was ſtronger than Death. He leaped over Mountains of Difficulties, and brake through Hoſts of Enemies, and Sufferings to Redeem them. He did forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a time, that he might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us to eternity: He veiled his Glory, and Majeſty, to manifeſt his Love to us: <hi>We are all as an unclean thing,</hi> Iſa. 64.6. but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is that Holy Thing that was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Luk. 1.35. he came into this World without a Foreskin on his Heart, and therefore was that Holy Seed that was Figured, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by Circumciſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. And we may Glory in him, on this account. The Fountain was pure from his Conception and Birth, and the Stream that did flow from it was ever after clear and clean. It was requiſite that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, that he might be made Righteouſneſs to us.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:41823:63"/>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings may well be accounted a part of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were the Fulfilling of the Law given to him as Mediator, that he ſhould make his Soul an Offering for Sin, and pour it out to the death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. As the Moral Law belonged to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a Man, he could not poſſeſs our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in Purity, or order his Converſation with Beauty without ſubmiſſion to it: ſo the Ceremonial Law belonged to him as a <hi>Jew;</hi> and he was obliged to die, as he was a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. <hi>He muſt be obedient to death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were part of his Righteouſneſs, becauſe they were the enduring of what <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> as a Surety, did undertake to undergoe. If one Man doth bind himſelf in a Bond to pay the Debt of another, it is but Juſtice that he ſhould ſatisfie it; if he refuſe, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it, he acts contrary to the Rules of Righteouſneſs. So when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> took our Debt on him, it was Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41823:63"/>that he ſhould pay it off. A Surety doth firſt make the Debt his own, and then binds himſelf to the payment of it: So <hi>Chriſt</hi> firſt took our ſins themſelves, and then became liable to puniſhment for them. As the Sacrifices of the Law had firſt Sins put, and laid on them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 4. and then thereby were expoſed to wounds and death. If <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had not been made ſin, he could not have been made a Curſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being made a Curſe ſeems ſomewhat different from his being made Sin, and was a Fruit, and Conſequent of it. The Curſe could not Fall, Faſten, or Abide on a Perſon, but where Sin opened the Door, drew, and pluckt it upon him. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by becoming a Surety, was ſnared, was taken by the words of his own Mouth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſaid to the Father, <hi>Pſal. Ch.</hi> 40.7, 8. <hi>Loe I come,</hi> that is, to be an Atoning Sacrifice: <hi>I delight to do thy will O my God;</hi> that is, to offer up my Body once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9, 10. Now <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was come into the Hand of his Father to be puniſhed,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41823:64"/>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.3. It was juſt for God the Father to wound and bruiſe him; to call the Sword of his Juſtice to awake againſt him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.6, 7. <hi>verſes;</hi> the Cup could not paſs from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but he muſt drink it: the Debt muſt be exacted of him, Chaſtiſement muſt be laid on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had engaged as a Surety to draw near to God, ſitting on a fiery Throne, holding a flaming Sword, and clothed with the garments of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. Sins being laid on <hi>Chriſt, Iſa.</hi> 53.6. Sorrows and Sufferings were to follow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4. becauſe he bare our ſins, he muſt alſo be burthened with our ſorrows. It was juſt with God, on this account, to wound the Man that was his Son, and to ſmite the Man that was his Fellow, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7. God's Sword had (as it were) ſlept for a long time in the Scabbard of his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering: his Juſtice had been ſilent, and not roared againſt Sinners. But now the Surety was come, the great Atoning Sacrifice was preſented, and exhibited, it was high time for God's Sword to awake. The Times before
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41823:64"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> were the days of Forbearance <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. God took <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Word till then, but now the Day of Payment was come, and therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not be ſecured from a Dark Hour, or be exempted from drinking of a bitter Cup, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39.42. <hi>John</hi> 12.27, 28. he came into the World to have ſuch a Terrible Hour, and to walk through the Dark Valley of the ſhadow of Death: As he was loaded with our Sins, God muſt not only forſake him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. but wound him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53, 5. He had not only a dark Night, as the Light of God's pleaſing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was hid from him, but he felt Dews, and experienc'd the Drops of the Night, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. as God's puniſhing hand was ſtretch'd out againſt him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not only a very Dark Night, but a very Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Tempeſtuous Night; as we had eſtranged our ſelves from God, and had forgotten our Relation to him, ſo God eſtranged himſelf from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſeemed, for a time, to veile, and forget his Relation to his Son: to carry it as a Stranger, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41823:65"/>as one unconcerned in the Sufferings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Pſal. 22.1, 2. <hi>My God! my God! why haſt thou forſaken me? Why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God! I cry unto thee in the day time, but thou heareſt not, and in the Night ſeaſon, and am not ſilent.</hi> O! how ſtrange is this, that God ſhould thus withdraw himſelf from his own Son? that the Father ſhould deliver him up into the hands, and leave him to the Will of his Enemies? That God's ear ſhould be ſtopt, and his Bowels ſhut up againſt his own Son: That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould roar out his dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Complaints, and yet God be, as it were, deaf and dumb to him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable towards him, when the Son was not ſilent to his Father day or night. Surely <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Cup was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitter, his Burthen heavy, and the Fire that Roaſted this Lamb of God was very hot, and ſcorching, or elſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> that had the Power of the God-head to ſupport him, was now in the midſt of his Enemies, and near the end of his Sufferings, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thus have roared out. The
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41823:65"/>words of the Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly Point out, and Foretel that which <hi>Matthew</hi> Records, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 46. <hi>And about the Ninth hour Jeſus cried with a loud voice, ſaying, Eli, Eli, Lama Sabachthani; that is to ſay, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> Yet <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> juſtifies the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in forſaking of him, in not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; <hi>But thou art holy, O thou that inhabiteſt the praiſes of Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 22.3. Though others taſt thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, admire, and glorifie thy Grace, and thou inhabiteſt their Praiſes, yet thou art deaf to me, I feel thy Wrath and Severity. But thou art holy in all this, I am come into thy hand as a Surety, and muſt fall under thy weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Arm as a God of Vengeance. This was the true reaſon and cauſe why <hi>Jeſus</hi> was wanting to himſelf, did not plead his own Cauſe; or more confute the Slanders, and wipe off the Reproaches his Enemies caſt on him, clear and juſtifie himſelf from their Calumnies, Falſe and Forged Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.3, 4, 5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> kept ſilence, he Anſwered nothing to what the High-Prieſt charged him
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41823:66"/>with. He alſo Anſwered nothing to <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſo that <hi>Pilate</hi> marvelled, that he would not plead for, and defend himſelf; that he carried it as if he had no Reply, no Reproofes in his Month, to vindicate himſelf, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence his Adverſaries. This Silence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was foretold, Iſa. 53.7. <hi>He was dumb, he opened not his Mouth.</hi> The truth was, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> took our Sins, and bare our Iniquities, in order to his ſubmitting to Puniſhment for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of face did belong to us, Dan.</hi> 9.8.9. Guilt might ſtop our Mouths, ſeale up our Lips. We had cauſe to lie down in our Shame, to cover our ſelves with Confuſion, never to open our Mouths to deny, extenuate, or juſtifie our Practiſes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>laſt. Chriſt</hi> now ſtood in our place, he did, as it were, aſſume our Perſon; Silence did become us; Our Cauſe was ſo bad, that it could not be pleaded or defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was Juſt, now, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be Condemned, Executed, Cut off for our Sins, that, as a Surety, he took on himſelf: though he was a Green Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Fruit-bearing-Tree, yet all our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41823:66"/>Barrenneſs was charged, all our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Fruits were hanged on the Tree of Life by Imputation, therefore a Fire was kindled againſt him; he was hewed down, and cut off from the Land of the Living, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſubmitting to Circumciſion, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.21. and to Baptiſme, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.13, 16. that were Ordinances proper and peculiar to Sinners, did ſhew, that he took our Sins on him, that we, in Baptiſme, might have our Sins put away, and his Righteouſneſs put on us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings may well be called, and accounted a part of his Righteouſneſs; becauſe, in bearing his Sufferings, he admirably exerciſed his Graces, and was moſt active in fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Law to the utmoſt height and pitch of Perfection. Indeed, mere Innocence is not Rewardable, but as it is accompanied and attended with an Active Obedience, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He ſubmitted to the Will of his Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.42. <hi>If this Cup may not paſs from me,</hi> except I drink it, <hi>thy will be done.</hi> He evidenced, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41823:67"/>and demonſtrated to the world, that he loved the Father, and would do what he commanded him: the Threatning of Death againſt us, was changed into a Commandment given to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he ſhould die. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would go forth to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the hands of his Enemies, and to meet Death, <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>laſt.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> manifeſted wonderful Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience towards his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and expreſſed admirable Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Praying for his Perſecutors and Murtherers, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.24. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> Sinners hated <hi>Chriſt</hi> without a cauſe, and he loved them without a cauſe. What aſtoniſhing kindneſs did <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> diſcover towards his Sheep, in that he would lay down his Life for them? <hi>John</hi> 10.11, 15. Was not the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a love paſſing knowledge? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.18, 19. Was it ever known, that when the Butcher came to the Fold to fetch Sheep and Lambs to kill them, that the Shepherd ſhould offer, and ſubſtitute himſelf in their room, and to be contented to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41823:67"/>be ſlain himſelf, that they might be ſpared. Some have thought, that this was a ſtrain of Love above, and beyond what the Law requires from one Neighbour towards another. Men are to Love their Neighbours as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> loved his Sheep more than himſelf; he forgot, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied himſelf: was ſwallowed up in moſt pure and ardent Love towards them. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. So that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was highly Righteous, and perfectly conformed to the Law in all his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Sorrows. Thus <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did Anſwer the Character, that the Church of Old gave of him, that he was <hi>white and ruddy, the chiefeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ten thouſand,</hi> Cant. 5.10. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> was White in his Active, and Ruddy in his Paſſive Obedience, and ſo did at once commend us to God's Holineſs, and ſecure us from his Wrath and Juſtice. As the Firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> in Tranſgreſſing the Poſitive Law God gave him, not to eat of the Forbidden Fruit, did violate the whole Moral Law, he was unjuſt to God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to himſelf, and cruel to all his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41823:68"/>Poſterity, whom he betrayed, defiled, and ruined: So the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> in Obeying a Poſitive Law, to Die, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the whole Moral Law, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love to God and Man, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Denial of Himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Second thing I am to inſiſt on, is, to Evidence, That <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son of God, <hi>is our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> No other but he that was God Manifeſted in the Fleſh, could now, in this degenerate ſtate of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man, ſatisfie, and fulfil the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law. <hi>The word of God is very pure,</hi> Pſal. 119.140. The <hi>Command is exceeding broad,</hi> Pſal. 119.96. The Law is very Spiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. There is a wonderful depth in the Law of God, it goeth deeper than the actual conſent of the Will: Others of the Ten Commandments, as the <hi>Fifth, Sixth, Seventh</hi> and <hi>Eighth,</hi> do forbid heart-evils, for the Law is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. It is the Law of an Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heart-ſearching Lawgiver, and therefore it is not only given to the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41823:68"/>Lip, and Life, but reaches and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the Soul. But the Tenth Commandment is yet more deep and ſpiritual, it forbiddeth the Firſt bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and ſtirrings of Sin in the Soul, whereby the Will is Tempted by it ſelf, and ſollicited to conſent and comply: Theſe are the Neighings of a Carnal Heart after fleſhly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. <hi>I have ſeen thy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, and thy Neighings:</hi> Theſe Neighings of an unclean heart do tend to Fornication, and Adultery. In theſe Firſt Covetings, and Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Old Man doth (as it were) caſt forth its ſeed into the Womb of the Heart; but Luſt doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in the Language of <hi>James, James</hi> 1.14, 15. till this Seed is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, cheriſhed, and embraced in the Womb of the Will; till it conſents, and yields to a Temptation. Who now of the beſt of the Sons of Men can ſtand before this holy and perfect Law of God? Dare the beſt of Saints in the World go to a Trial before God on the account of their Works? Did not <hi>David</hi> himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline ſuch a Trial? Did he not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41823:69"/>wave, and deprecate it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.23. <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, For in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be juſtified.</hi> But this is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he was a Spiritual Beauty among defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> an upright Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong crooked Creatures: one that did dwell in the Torrid Zone of Love, when the Hearts of others were Congealed, and Frozen towards God. He had the higheſt flame of Love, and not the leaſt ſpark of Luſt. But the obedience of no others is of ſufficient purity, according to the Covenant of Works, to be Tried at God's Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, or of Weight enough to hold in God's Ballance: But <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for Purity, and Weight, will be approved before the Tribunal of God. The Eye of Omniſciency can ſee no fault in it; the Holineſs of God is not diſſatisfied with it, but highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it, and delights in it. As no meer Creature can ſatisfie for the Guilt of Sin, and ſo prevent Eternal Death; ſo the obedience of no mere Creature can Merit Eternal Life. The Command of the Law muſt be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41823:69"/>as well as the Curſe executed; there muſt be a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <p n="2">2. No other but <hi>Jehovah</hi> could bear the Weight of Millions of Sins, and endure ſufficient Puniſhment for them.

The Mighty God therefore muſt ſupport the frail Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For God to hide his Pleaſing Countenance from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was (as it were) the loſs of a Heaven for a ſeaſon; and, for God to turn his Angry Frowning Face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was the Feeling of a Hell for a Time. Who could bear this Loſs, this Puniſhment, but he that had Omnipotency to uphold him? There were ſeveral things that were extraordinary in the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo that none but he could bear, and ſuffer at that rate, and in that manner.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41823:70"/>when all left him; and the Father too is ſaid to forſake him; yet he ſaith, <hi>I am not alone; but the Father is with me,</hi> John 16.32. when God did preſs down a weight of Sufferings on him, yet he was perſwaded, that, at that very time, he put his Allmighty and Everlaſting Arms under him to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, Iſa. 42.1. <hi>Behold my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom I uphold,</hi> Iſa. 50.7. <hi>The Lord God will help me.</hi> When God did lay Sins on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. yet he believed he would Juſtifie him from them all, Iſa. 50.8. <hi>He is near that juſtifieth me.</hi> Though he was now under a dark Night, yet he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God would turn his Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death into a bright and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Morning, Pſal. 16: 11. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of Life: in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Loved God, even when he was wounded by him, and ſuffered ſuch hard things from him. The Damned ſuffer from God, and hate him: they belch and vomit out Blaſpemies againſt him. But
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41823:71"/>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> endured the moſt bitter, and grievous things from the Father's Hand, yet ſtill loved him: This was the Fat of the Inwards of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.8. that his Soul was filled with the Fear of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xi. 2. and had ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Humility, and made ſuch a deep and hearty Submiſſion to the Will of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.42. which did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ennoble the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is very obſervable, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the Celebration of his Laſt Supper, twice Gave Thanks to God at the Conſecration of the Bread, and the Bleſſing of the Cup, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. What can we conceive was the ſubject matter of his Thankſgiving, but that he bleſſed his Father for ſetting him forth to be a Propitiation, for Sanctifying and Sending him into the World to be an High-Prieſt, <hi>John</hi> 10.36. and for Ordaining him to be a Sacrifice, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.19, 20. For giving him, as Bread from Heaven, to feed Famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures, and deſigning his Blood as a generous Cordial to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port fainting Souls. O what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41823:71"/>Spirit did <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſcover in Bleſſing of God, that made a Spiritual Feaſt on himſelf, as a Paſchal-Lamb and Sacrifice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> This was wonderful, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was but one Lamb, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. 1 <hi>John</hi> 29. did bear ſo many Sins, yea Thouſands and Millions of Tranſgreſſions, and yet did not ſink under them. He was a Tried Stone, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. Never was there ſuch a Weight of Sins and Sufferings laid on any one, as on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet he did not break, or ſink under this Weight. As God put Sins on <hi>Chriſt, Iſa.</hi> 53.6. ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> put them away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Aaron</hi> did confeſs all the Sins of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> over the Scape-Goat, and lay them on him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.21. but his Memory might fail us to a perfect Enumeration of the kinds, and ſorts of their ſins But God laid the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of all his People on <hi>Chriſt, Iſa.</hi> 53.6.8. and ſurely God that knew them all, remembred, and recorded them all; did not omit, over-ſlip, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to lay any of them on <hi>Chriſt:</hi> therefore the number of Iniquities
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41823:72"/>laid on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was not to be recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conceived, comprehended. Theſe many ſins brought ſuch great Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that when he took a view of the Sea of Sorrows he was to paſs through, he began to be ſore amaz'd, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33. and wen he came into the Garden he was in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. <hi>Heſychius,</hi> a Learned <hi>Greek</hi> Author, ſayes, that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is derived from <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, properly ſignifies that vehement fear of Death that falls on Soldiers, when they are about to join Battel with an Enemy. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Prince of Darkneſs, the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Hell, and his Bands and Troops on Earth; and the ſight of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Enemies, and the Greatneſs of his dangers and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from above, and from beneath, did put <hi>Chriſt</hi> into Agony. The Lamb of God was to Combate with a Roaring Lion, the Unicorns of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Spirits were to ſet on him; the <hi>Jews,</hi> as Bulls of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> as Dogs, were to aſſault <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Pſal.</hi> 22.12, 13, 16, 21. The True <hi>Iſrael</hi> was now to Wreſtle with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41823:72"/>the Wrath of God, the Curſe of the Law, the Rage of Hell; yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to ſatisfie Juſtice, quench the Fire of the Wrath of God, defeat the Policy, and diſarm the Power of Hell; while Satan, the Old Serpent, nibled at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Heels, he Trod upon, and bruiſed his Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> That <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſuffered ſo, that he made an end of Sin, finiſhed the Tranſgreſſion: he did ſo take ſin on him, that he took it away, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. ſo bare it, that he did bare it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for ever. The words uſed in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. are very emphatical; <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> Died <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Lecalleh,</hi> to make an end of Sin; that there ſhould never need, or be any more Offerings for Sin. Some render the word reſtrain, or to Impriſon: this is our ſafety, that ſin is ſo Confined and Impriſoned for ever, that it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more be at liberty to come forth to give Evidence, or Teſtifie againſt us. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Lecathem,</hi> ſignifies to Seale up. This is intimated, that Tranſgreſſions (as Rolls) ſhould be ſealed up; they ſhould be kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41823:73"/>and ſecret; the Long Rolls of our Tranſgreſſions ſhould be ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up, as never more to be opened and Read.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Lecappher</hi> ſignifies to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, Expiate Iniquity, ſo as to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and that not ſlightly, as by ſpreading a Cloath over it, that may be eaſily taken away; but to cover, by Plaiſtering over a thing. The word intimates, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sin, that it is never more to be ſeen: It is ſo Blotted out by his Blood, that it is never more to be Read; ſo Drowned, that it is never more to appear. <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his once Offering hath perfected for ever them that are Sanctified, and put an end to all Sacrifices for Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14, 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo ſuffered for Sin, that in a ſhort time he removed the Guilt of it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.9. God ſaith he would remove the Iniquity of that Land in one day. O! How wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this, that Guilt which had been contracting, Sins that had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many Hundreds, yea ſome Thouſands of years, that theſe ſhould
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41823:73"/>be ſatisfied for in one day, and ſhould be ſo ſoon purged away? <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. That what Sinners had been Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Hundreds of years, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould blot it out in one day. When Sins had long cried loud, and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured in the Ears of God, that all theſe ſhould be ſtilled, and ſilenced in one day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly.</hi> For <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Taſting death but part of three days, to aboliſh it for ever, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. by a ſhort courſe of Obedience, to bring in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. and by Temporary Sufferings, to obtain an Eternal Redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. this none could do but <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> Incarnate. In the Sacrifices of the Law there was a Remembrance again of Sins every year, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.3. though there were Sacrifices offered daily to make Atonement for Sin, and a Multitude of theſe were ſlain in a Year, yet on the Day of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that came the Tenth Day of the Seventh Moneth, every Year, there was a Solemn Confeſſion, and Remembrance of Sins again, <hi>Levit.</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:41823:74"/>16.21, 27, 29. which evidences the weakneſs and imperfection of all the Legal Sacrifices, that they could never take away Sin, or make the comers to thoſe Sacrifices perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.11. but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by one Offering, perfects us for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s one Sacrifice was the Truth and Subſtance of all the Sacrifices of the Law of the Burnt-offering, 1 <hi>John</hi> 29. of the Sin-offering, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. of the Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs-offering, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Chriſt</hi> made his Soul <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Treſpaſs-offering. Therefore, on the account of this one perfect Sacrifice, God ſaith he will remember Sins and Iniquities no more. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.17. Hence it is very right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred, very juſtly concluded, where Remiſſion of Sins is, there is no more Offering for Sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Benefits that we receive by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s doing and ſuffering the will of God, do Evidence, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>our Righteouſneſs,</hi> and our only <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that gave his Life a Ranſome for many, <hi>Matth.</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:41823:74"/>20.28. we did not contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, or make up any part of it. We cannot give to God a Ranſom for our Bodies, to prevent Temporal Death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.78.9. How then could we provide a Ranſome for our Souls to prevent Eternal Death? we could not ſatisfie Juſtice, that our Bonds might be looſed, our Priſon door opened, as God the Father found out the way of Redemption, <hi>Job</hi> 33.24. <hi>I have found a Ranſome;</hi> So God the Son paid the Ranſome, and found Eternal Redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. He gave his Fleſh for the Life of the World, <hi>John</hi> 6.51. he was ſlain, and Redeemed us to God by his Blood, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. As the Ram was the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 22.12, 13. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s hand was ſtaid, the Life of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> was ſpared, and the Ram was offered up in ſtead of him: So we were bound with Chains of Guilt, the Juſtice of God was ready to give us the Fatal Stroke, the Mortal Wound; we were under the Sentence of death, and knew not how we ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; but then <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in our Room, and this Lamb
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41823:75"/>of God was offered as a Ranſome for us; therefore our Righteouſneſs is wholly of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We do not feed on, or live by Food of our own providing; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Living Bread, and Bread of Life to us, <hi>John</hi> 6.48.50, 51. He came down from Heaven, that we might eat, and not die. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks of a double giving, <hi>John</hi> 6.51. Firſt, He gave his Fleſh upwards, in Sacrifice to God his Father, ſo he gave his fleſh for the Life of the World. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he gives it downwards, as Food and Suſtenance to us. There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrifice for God, or Bread for us to be found in this lower World, but both muſt come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. By our Fall and Apoſtacy from God, we have brought our ſelves into a Barren Spiritual Wilderneſs, as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they came out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> into the Wilderneſs, they could not ſubſiſt there, but by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and Miraculous Proviſion that God made for them. God Rained down Manna from the Clouds, and fed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with the Corn of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41823:75"/>Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.24. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> may more truly and properly be called the Corn of Heaven. This very Bread did firſt ſpring up in the Mind, and grow in the Heart of God: he laid the great Deſign of a Spiritual Feaſt for fainting and famiſhing Souls. He Predeſtinated <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be a Sacrifice to himſelf, and Food to us. This is a great and wonderful Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Grace, that Bread ſhould come down from Heaven to Nouriſh us. Bread ſhould naturally Grow out of the Earth for our Souls, as well as for our Bodies. Our Righteouſneſs ſhould ſpring, and grow out of our ſelves, and be wrought by our ſelves; but none of us have any thing of our own to relieve our ſelves with, to ſubſiſt upon, or to keep our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live by, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.29. none could keep alive his own Soul, we were ready to periſh with Famine as the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17. Now what aſtoniſhing Kindneſs is this, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be a Sacrifice, that Sinners might have a Feaſt on him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. Believers are made Spiritual Prieſts, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.6. and this is their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41823:76"/>Priviledge, Honour and Happineſs, that they have an Altar to eat off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. In the Times of the Law none might eat of a Sacrifice, that was offered for their Sins: if the Prieſt offered Sacrifice for his own Sins, he might not eat of any part of it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.10, 11. thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered for Sin, did not yield a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Food or Suſtenance to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers that brought them. This did evidence, and argue their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and imperfection, that they could not feed, or nouriſh thoſe that brought them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.30. it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that no Offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Congregation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile withall in the Holy Place, ſhall be eaten: it ſhall be burnt in the fire. But this is the Excellency of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sacrifice, that though he was made Sin, and a Treſpaſs-offering, yet we are called to Feed on, and Eat his Body that was broken, and Sacrificed for us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. There is ſtill Food on <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Altar, it is never empty. The Altar was called God's Table, <hi>Mal.</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:41823:76"/>1.12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41.22. and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is called his Meat. God did, as it were, Feed at this Table. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar Figured <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and he Offered his Humane Nature as a Sacrifice on the Altar of his Divine Nature; and this True Sacrifice was God's Meat: Here Divine Juſtice did Feed, and was ſatisfied. What an Honour is this for us, to be admitted as Gueſts, yea, as Children, to God's Table? and for our Faith to feed on the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that Juſtice is ſatisfied with; that may well quiet our Conſciences, that Pacifies God's Wrath: The Sacrifice and Meat on the Altar is called the Fruit of it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.12. This Phraſe is very obſervable, that the Altar is compared to a Field, that did yield and bear Fruit to the Prieſts; they had not Lands, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances as the other <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had; but the Altar was their Inheritance, and their Field, the part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered on the Altar, that was allowed to them, for their Services was the Fruit of the Altar, that they Fed on, and were ſuſtained by. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Altar is our Field; on the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41823:77"/>Fruit of it, even his Sacrifice, our Souls muſt Live, In <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. it is ſaid. That he that doth the Law, and the things required in it, ſhall live by them. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> Teacheth us another way of Subſiſtence for our Souls, <hi>John</hi> 6.57. <hi>He that eateth me ſhall live by me.</hi> Our Drink alſo is not in, or from our ſelves; we are in a Pit in which there is no Water, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was Figured by the Rock that was ſmitten by the Rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> even the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3.4. Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as a Servant, made the Law, and perfectly obeyed it, was Holy to God, Harmleſs to others, and undefiled in himſelf, yet he Felt the Rod of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> he endured the Curſe. We were in a Dry, and Barren Wilderneſs, where no Water was: we muſt have periſhed with Thirſt, had not <hi>Chriſt</hi> been Smitten. He did cleave, his Soul and Body were ſeparated from each other, and ſo Spiritual Waters did guſh out for us to Drink. God's Sword might have devoured our Fleſh, and his Arrows have been
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41823:77"/>made drunk with our blood, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.42. but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> gave us his Fleſh to be Meat indeed, and his Blood to be Drink indeed, <hi>John</hi> 6.53, 54, 55. We are too prone to dig and ſeek Spiritual Water in our ſelves, but we muſt look for it from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Travelling <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſſing through the Valley of <hi>Bacha,</hi> did make it a Well, they digged deep to find Water in the Earth; but yet at laſt they were diſappointed, and the Rain did fill the Pools, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.6. They ſought Water from beneath, but They received it from above. So we would find Water in our ſelves, but we muſt periſh, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not Rain upon us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.6. He ſhall come down like the Rain on the Mown Graſs: as Showers that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Earth. <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their Tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſrael will not forſake them. I will make the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs a Pool of Water, and the dry Land Springs of Water,</hi> Iſa. 41.17, 18. <hi>If any Man thirſt,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>let him come to me and drink,</hi> John 7.37. we
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41823:78"/>cannot live by a fullneſs and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in our ſelves, but we muſt live by Bread from without, by eating of the Fleſh, and drinking of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And this alſo is given us freely. We reap that we ſowed not, and eat that we did not labour for; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> lived in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without Plowing and Sowing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are Healed, not by any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy we have invented, or by any Medicine that we have prepared, but by a wonderful Remedy, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath provided. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Murmured in the Wilderneſs, and were for it bitten by Fiery Serpents; and their burning poyſon did kill many of them: thoſe that were hurt, were utterly at a loſs. They knew no Phyſical Herbs, no Soveraign Drugs, no proper Remedies to apply. They knew not how to draw out the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Poyſon, but were deſtroyed by it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.6, 7, 8. The Wilderneſs they were in afforded no Medicines; but God deviſed, prepared, revealed a Remedy: he directed <hi>Moſes</hi> to make a <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> and to hang it on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41823:78"/>high upon a Pole, and promiſed to bleſs this Remedy, and render it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, that whoſoever looked to it, ſhould be healed and live. So Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was bitten by Satan, that Old Serpent, in Paradiſe. He drew them to Diſcredit God's Threatning: he Leavened them with hard and baſe Thoughts of God: that he envied their higher Knowledge, and greater Happineſs, and ſo put a reſtraint on them, Forbidding them to eate of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and ſo drew them to Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and to caſt off the Authority, and Yoke of God. Hereby Humane Nature was corrupted, and poyſoned in our Firſt Parents, and by them this Vermin did ſpread, and diffuſe it ſelf into all their Poſterity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the whole World. This Bite of the Old Serpent was deadly. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and Anguiſh belongs to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul that Sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>laſt. Sin hath reigned unto Death,</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>laſt.</hi> but God hath provided a Remedy, that we could never have imagined, or thought of; and was moſt remote
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41823:79"/>from the Sentiments, and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Natural Man: The Son of God came down from Heaven, took our Fleſh, and Suffered in our Nature; was lifted up to the Croſs, and died on it; that whoſoever looks to him, and believes to him, and believes on him, may not periſh, but have Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was lifted up before the eyes of God, when he was Crucified, and he is lifted up before our eyes, when his Death is Preached, and he is evidently ſet forth as Crucified before us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. We are not to compoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, or to provide Plaiſters of our own to heal our ſelves, but we are to look to, and make uſe of God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy continually. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. doth probably aſſert, That the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as they Journied, and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from one Station to another, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> along with them, and ſet it up again in their Camp; and, as often as any one was bitten, he looked to it for Healing. So we muſt receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> to dwell in our hearts by Faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. and ſtill carry him about with us, that as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41823:79"/>often as we contract New Guilt, we may look to him with a Spiritual eye, and be Healed. The Life that we live in the fleſh, we muſt live continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Faith of the Son of God, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.20. All the Healing Remedies are out of our ſelves, and are in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> His Stripes are Healing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. he hath healing beames, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. out of the ſide of the Altar there came forth Living Waters, that healed the corrupt and dead Sea, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41.1, 2, 8. ſo out of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſide there came forth Water and Blood, <hi>John</hi> 19.34. The Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Soveraign Remedy againſt the Guilt of Sin; and the Spirit that was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Water that flowed out of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſide, is a ſovereign Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Filth, and Reigning power of Sin; And <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Tree of Life, beares Leaves for the Healing of the Nations, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.2. No other Tree hath Healing Leaves, but only <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> his Word, Doctrine, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, are Healing Leaves. We do not Work to Cure our ſelves; tho' we are Patients, yet we cannot be our own Phyſitians, but we are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41823:80"/>by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Condemnation, and live by his Death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are not Waſhed in any Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our own providing, or in any Bath of our own making, but God the Father hath opened a Fountain for ſin, and uncleanneſs, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. and this Fountain is opened where we could never have thought of, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined any ſuch thing, even in the pierced ſide, and wounded heart of the Son of God. His Head was Crowned with Thornes: his Hands and Feet were nailed to the Croſs, his Side was pierced, and Blood did flow from thence to Purifie our Souls. This is noble and precious Blood indeed, that affects Conſcience, and reaches ſo far, as to purifie it. The Blood of Sacrifices, the Aſhes of an Heifer, and Clean Water, availed only to the Purification of the Fleſh, to take off Ceremonial Uncleanneſs: but <hi>Chriſt</hi> poured out his own Blood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made a Precious Laver, a Coſtly Bath. This Blood purgeth Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from ſins, that are dead Works, as they are the Fruits of Spiritual
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41823:80"/>Death, and the Seeds of Eternal Death. Though Conſcience be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and doth not feel the weight of theſe dead Works, yet if they remain unpurged, they will revive, and ſting the Soul to death; they will return upon it, and ſink it to Hell. There is no other means to purifie, and pacifie Conſcience but this Blood, and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly need it. There is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Iniquity in us, that continually flows to defile us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.7. <hi>As a Fountain caſts out its Waters, ſo Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem caſts out her Wickedneſs.</hi> It is well for us that there is a Fountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to take off that Guilt that is contracted by the Flowings of that Filthy Fountain that is within us. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Blood, though it is little in quantity, yet it is mighty in Virtue. There is a deep Sea of Merit in it, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18, 19. Thoug it was pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his Body but a few hours, yet it is a Fountain that Flowes in all Ages and Generations to take away Sin. And is not this moſt ſweet and comfortable, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did not only ſhed his Blood, but ſprinkles it alſo, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41823:81"/>water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs.</hi> Clean Water to waſh the Body is common, but clean Water to purifie the Soul is rare, and no where to be found but in Chriſt. This is wonderful Grace, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not only ſhed his Blood, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes alſo to ſprinkle it. He ſhed it with unexpreſſible Pain and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, but he Sprinkles it with much Pleaſure and Delight. As he pitied Souls, and ſhed his Blood for them, ſo he Loves Soules, and Sprinkles it on them, and Waſhes them in this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from their Uncleanneſs, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.56. We are not clothed by our own Works, or Righteouſneſs. Our Webs cannot become Garments, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.6. Our beſt Performances cannot clothe us.

Sometimes we do good Works, and then are apt to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and to commit evil Works. There are interruptions in our obedience: Sin doth too often intervene, ſo that theſe patches of the Old Man do much blemiſh, and disfigure the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Righteouſneſs. There are Breaches in our Walls, and Spots in our Garments. As we need clean Water to Puriſie us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. ſo we alſo want clean Linnen to Clothe, and Adorn us, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> invites us to come to him, to buy White Rayment, that the ſhame of our Nakedneſs may not appear, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Angel that commanded the Filthy Garments to be taken from <hi>Joſhuah</hi> the High-Prieſt: he cauſed his Iniquities to paſs away, and Clothed him with change of Rayment, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.4.

The matter of thoſe Coats was the Skins of Beaſts, that probably were ſlain, and offered in Sacrifice to God. This might inſtruct and teach them, that the Spiritual Cloathing of their Souls was to be borrowed from the Obedience, and Righteouſneſs of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41823:82"/>Great Atoning Sacrifice. As many as are Baptized into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have put on <hi>Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.27. Our Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents did ſow Fig-leaves together, to make Aprons to hide their ſhame, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. but when God provided Coats of Skin for them, then they threw away their Aprons of Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves as uſeleſs. So every Man, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, ſeeks ſome Aprons of Works, and righteouſneſs of his own to cover his Nakedneſs, when Conſcience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them for ſin, and the Law of God Condemns them for Iniquity. The Whore, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.14. pleads, That ſhe had Peace-offerings with her, and that day ſhe had paid her Vowes; and with this Apron ſhe thought to hide the Filthineſs of her Adultery. But when Men come acquainted with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> and have that Glorious Clothing revealed to them, which he hath proved for Souls, then they caſt away their Aprons of Works, and their own Imaginary Righteouſneſs. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That thoſe things that he reputed his Gains, that he thought would gain him the Favour of God, Acceptance with God, a Title to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting

Mr. <hi>Terry,</hi> in the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Travels</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> obſerves, That where the Heat is exceeding great, as it is in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> there the Trees do bear far larger, and longer Leaves than in theſe parts of the World, and that thereby they afford a ſtronger ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow againſt the vehement heat of the Sun. Since the Fall we need a ſtrong ſhadow againſt the Scorching Wrath of God; and it is our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Tree of Life, that hath ſuch broad and long Leaves, as to afford a moſt ſweet, Cooling and Reviving Shadow. When the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> Travelled through the Black Burning Sands of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where, in ſome places, there grew no Trees to ſhadow them, God did, by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Miracle of his Grace, for Forty years, ſpread a continual Cloud over them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.39. and this was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41823:84"/>for a Covering, to ſecure them from the fiery burning heat of the Sun, that they might not Faint under it, and be killed by it. <hi>Lithgow,</hi> that did Travel through <hi>Arabia,</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that the Heat is ſo great, by the Reflexion of the Sun-beams on thoſe Sands, that he ſaw two <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> that were of their Company, and in their Caravan, to drop down dead, being overcome by the Heat of the Sun. This Hiſtory inſtructs us how abſolutely neceſſary God's Cloud was, which he ſpread over them: It was not the Tents of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were ſufficient to keep off the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat; elſe God would not have provided this Miraculous Cloud; ſo it is not the Tents of our Works, or Righteouſneſs, that can keep off the Scorching Wrath of God, but it muſt be the Righteouſneſs that the Clouded Son of God wrought out, in the ſtate of his Humiliation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement. As thoſe that went from under the Shadow of this Cloud, were preſently Scorched by the Sun; ſo thoſe that wave, and decline <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, muſt needs, ſooner or
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41823:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>later, feel the Burning Wrath of God. That Cloud that Skreen'd the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the Beames of the Sun, was, it ſelf, ſtill expoſed to the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat, but the Cloud did not feel it. But our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is our Shadowing Cloud, had a tender Senſe, a ſharp feeling of the Wrath of God for a time, that he might be a laſting and perpetual Cloud to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and ſecure us from it. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> continually, for near Forty years, Travelled under the Shadow of this Cloud; ſo we muſt, all our days, Journey under the Shadow of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Righteouſneſs. I have Read in <hi>Varenius</hi> his <hi>Geography,</hi> of this Great Wonder of Providence, and Mercy of God to the People in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> that they have their <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> when the Sun is over their heads, and their <hi>Summer,</hi> when the Sun is moſt remote from them: Then the Sky is continually clear, and the Sun ſhines ſo hot, that in ſome places they keep their Fairs and Markets, and do their Buſineſs in the Night, and ſleep in the Day. But when the Sun is in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and juſt over their heads,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41823:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>then they have perpetual Clouds, and much Rain; and that if it were not for this, the Country could not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably inhabited, by reaſon of the Great Exceſſive Heat: So, were not the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Cloud over us, to ſhadow us by his Righteouſneſs, the moſt Holy Souls could not poſſeſs and inhabit a cool and comfortable place in the Church. It is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Sufferings that is the Tilt and Covering of the Chariot, in which we Ride with <hi>Chriſt</hi> to Heaven. King <hi>Solomon,</hi> that is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> made himſelf a Chariot, and the Covering of it was Purple. A Chariot muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over it to keep off the Wind, Rain, and Scorching Sun. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of this Chariot was Purple, that is, Cloth of a Purple Colour; and this ſignified the Obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was ſignally expreſſed in the ſhedding of his Blood. His Righteouſneſs was as Cloth died in Purple Blood; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> paved his Chariot with Love, a ſoft Seat for Doubting Trembling Souls to ſit on; ſo he Tilted it over with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41823:85"/>Died in Blood, that Believers might be ſafe, and have a ſure Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that would keep off the Scorching Heat of God's Wrath. We cannot move towards Heaven, till we get up into <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Chariot; ſo we cannot Travel ſafely, but under its Purple Covering, this muſt be our Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all our days. Though the Church be a Garden open towards Heaven, to receive Influences of Grace from thence, yet it Rides in a Chariot that is Covered, and guarded from ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beams, and dreadful ſtorms from Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We are not ſecured from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging, and Deſtroying Juſtice, by any Good, or Righteouſneſs that dwells in us, but by the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Sprinkled from without, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our Conſciences, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.22, 23. The Deſtroying Angel did not paſs over the Houſes of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> and ſpare their Firſt-born, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Righteouſneſs of the Perſons within, but becauſe of the Blood ſprinkled from without.

                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:41823:86"/>23.2. and therefore were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be delivered from thence, but fitted to be deſtroyed there. It was therefore the Blood of the Paſchal Lamb, an eminent Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that was their Security from Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks, that God alludes to this in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.19. God ſaith, <hi>I will ſet a Sign among them;</hi> that is, on thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that ſhould eſcape the Wrath of God, and Deſtruction by it. And what is this Sign but the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> applied to the Soul; for we are ſaid to be Juſtified by his Blood, and ſo to be ſaved from the Wrath to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. it is not our Inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that will protect us from Reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice. The Spirit that dwelleth in us, even in us Saints, <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>luſteth unto Envy,</hi> James 4.5. <hi>In me, even in this fleſh of mine, dwelleth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all that is good,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.18. As <hi>Jacob</hi> did Travel towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet he halted on one Foot as he Journied on, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.31. So, though Saints do walk with God, and hold on their way towards Heaven, <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. yet they halt on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41823:86"/>the Unregenerate ſide, and part <hi>With my Mind I ſerve the Law of God' but with my Fleſh the Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>laſt.</hi> This is a wonderful Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel, that Believers are perfected, as to the Conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. Though <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Law could not make them that brought them perfect, as touching the Conſcience,</hi> Heb. 9.9. they did Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Pardon, they did Typify Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; but they could not confer and beſtow Pardon, and Peace. But this is the Excellency, and Perfection of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sacrifice, that it doth Purge and Perfect Conſcience; though the Soul, and its Faculties, are not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Compleat Inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet Conſcience is Perfected, and hath no more ground to Accuſe, and Condemn, than as if there were no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption remaining, no Sin dwelling in us. O what a Myſtery of Grace is this, that Conſcience ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and yet the Soul remain imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Grace!</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Our own Inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo defective, and comes ſo ſhort
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41823:87"/>of a full Conformity to the Law, that we cannot dwell at home; but muſt fly unto, and inhabit in the City of Refuge. Though the Old Man be wounded in every Member in the Saints, yet it is not Maimed, no one of our Members on Earth is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cut off, 3 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not ſtay at home, or dare to be found in our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. As the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer was not to continue at his Houſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.15, 22, 24, 25. He was in haſt to leave it, and fly to the City of Refuge, and there to abide till the Death of the High-Prieſt. Tho' a Man did, without Enmity, Hatred, or Deſign, but by meer Chance Kill his Neighbour, yet he muſt not abide at Home. Then we that have ſinned knowingly, and that with the bent and purpoſe of our Hearts have Tranſgreſſed a Righteous Law ſet before us, do much more need <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as a City of Refuge. We are in more danger of Revenging Juſtice, than the Man-ſlayer was of the Avenger of Blood. O! how much Mercy is it, that we have a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41823:87"/>of Refuge to fly to; tho' we have ſined greatly, and heinouſly? When <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our High-Prieſt died, when the Temple of his Body was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, <hi>John</hi> 2.19. then was this City of Refuge built up. It is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inhabited by Creatures, that have been Guilty of Heinous, and Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Tranſgreſſions. O what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is this, that there is yet Room in the City of Refuge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Guilty Creatures that fly to it? And what great need have we of it, not only for our Acts, that are meer Sins; but alſo for the beſt of our Duties and Performances? There is Iniquity that cleaves to our Holy Things, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.36, 37, 38. We need an High-Prieſt, not only for our Deformed Facts of Sin, but for our Beautiful Acts of Worſhip, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Droſs that is in them; our High-Prieſt did bear the Iniquity of our Holy Things: they lay Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy on him. And can we purchaſe Heaven by thoſe things that we need a Pardon, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> endured a Heavy Puniſhment for? If the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer did come forth, and was found
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41823:88"/>without the Borders of the City of Refuge, the Avenger of Blood might kill him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.26, 27. So if the beſt of Saints ſhould go forth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the City of Refuge, and think to dwell at Home, by truſting in their own Inherent Righteouſneſs, God's Revenging Juſtice might deſtroy them: therefore it is our wiſdom and ſafety to abide in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.28. <hi>Little children, abide in him.</hi> Becauſe we are but weak little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not grown to perfect ſtrength, and full ſtature in Grace, we are ſtill to abide in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to me to refer to that expreſſion of the Man-ſlayer's; being found without the Border of the City of Refuge, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.26. where he expreſſes it as his Great Deſign, and Deſire to be found in <hi>Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.9. The Man-ſlayer, and the Avenger of Blood might converſe freely and comfortably together, without fear of danger, in the City of Refuge. So a God of Vengeance, and a Believing Sinner may have ſweet Communion with each other in the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> That Juſt One died for the Unjuſt,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41823:88"/>to bring them to God; not as Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Malefactors, to be puniſhed, but as Reconciled Friends, to be Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. By the better hope we draw nigh to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Noah,</hi> though a ſincere and Juſt Man, was not to ſtay in his Tent or Houſe, but to leave it, and enter into the <hi>Ark,</hi> that he might not be Drowned by the Waters of the Flood; ſo we muſt go out of our ſelves, fly to, and truſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as God's Ark of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that we may be deliver'd from Deſtruction by the Deluge of God's Wrath.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We do not aſcend up to Heaven by a Lofty Tower, or by a Proud <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> of our own Building; the Top of our higheſt Structure cannot reach Heaven as thoſe Fooliſh Builders thought theirs would do, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.3, 4. Our Sins are increaſed, and grown up to Heaven, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. If our Treſpaſs be grown up to Heaven (as <hi>Ezra</hi> acknowledges) if our Sins af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, provoke, and dare God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us, How ſhall our Righteouſneſs grow up to Heaven, to enter into it,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41823:89"/>and take poſſeſſion of it? We de ſerve, by our Iniquities, to be thrown down to Hell, and do not Merit, by our Righteouſneſs, to Aſcend up to Heaven. If Men could fly to Heaven by the Wings of their own Works, or get up thither by the Ladder of their own Righteouſneſs, What need was there that God ſhould provide, and ſet up a Ladder to Heaven for us? <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was Travelling to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> and in a Dream God minds him of the Great Journey up to Heaven, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers to him a Ladder, the Foot of which did ſtand on Earth, and the top of which did reach Heaven. By this Ladder was ſignified both the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that was to be God-man, and ſo at once to ſtand on Earth, and reach to Heaven; and the Office of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that, as Mediator, was to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God and Man, and ſo joyn Earth and Heaven together. The Foot of this Ladder ſtood in <hi>Bethel,</hi> which ſignifies the Houſe of God: In the Church <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Mediator is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and Preached. At the top of this Ladder is the Gate of Heaven,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41823:89"/>
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.16, 17. Heaven is only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible, and open, over this Ladder, to thoſe that climb, and aſcend up by it. This Ladder is now Compleat in all the Rongs or Parts of it; the Foot of the Ladder ſtood near the Head of Sleeping <hi>Jacob;</hi> this might point, that the Ladder is Raiſed from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sleeping the ſleep of Death. <hi>Jeſus</hi> is now not only Born, and hath Died, but is Riſen again; and is Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to Heaven, ſits at the Right Hand of God, to make Interceſſion for us, that we may ſee and ſhare with him in his Glory, and be with him for ever, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath, as it were, pointed at all the Rongs of this Spiritual Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſhews us it is compleat, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. Though Satan ſtands at our right hand, to accuſe us for our Sins, as he did <hi>Joſhua</hi> for his Filthy Garments, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.3. yet <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is at God's Right Hand, to Plead, and Interceed for us. Our Sins Cry, and Satan Accuſes, but the Blood of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the Mediator Speaks for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. God that is infinitely Wiſe, Holy, and Juſt, ſaw our need of this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41823:90"/>Ladder, elſe he would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it by the wonderful abaſement, and grievous Sufferings of his Son: we cannot get up to Heaven by our own Righteouſneſs. Many of the Elect continue ſeveral years in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Eſtate; all theſe years are loſt, and ſo the Ladder is too ſhort to reach Heaven; their Righteouſneſs doth not begin ſoon, and early e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when they are Converted; there are many ſtops, and Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Obedience. The Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when it is begun, it is much bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; many Rongs or Rounds of the Ladder are wanting. Who can poſſibly climb, or aſcend up to a high place, where there are many Rongs or Rounds of a Ladder broken? This will put a ſtop to them: much more are we then una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Aſcend to a Heavenly Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Glory, by the Ladder of a broken Righteouſneſs, and by Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Works ſo interrupted, ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed and Defective.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We do not purchaſe a Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom, or Inheritance, by our

We are Heires, not by our Doing, but by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Dying. <hi>Job</hi> complaines, that God made him to poſſeſs the Iniquites of his Youth. <hi>Broughton</hi> Renders the Hebrew word, <hi>Thou makeſt me to Heir the Iniquities of my Youth. Job</hi> puts this Conſtruction on all his Afflictions and Sufferings, that God made him in them <hi>to Heir the fruits of all his youthful ſins.</hi> If God ſhould deal with us according to our deſervings, by bitter and ſharp Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, we might Heir the Sins of Youth and riper years; and not only Heir them in Temporal Evils, but in Eternal Puniſhments. How much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we need to be made Heires of Glory by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Teſtament? This is very obſervable, that <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Son of the Free-woman, a Type of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Covenant of Grace, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Heir while he was but an Infant, and had done no Works of Obedience, or Service, to oblige <hi>Abraham</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.8.10. <hi>Sarah</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as the Heir; yea, the Sole Heir

So, many that do live Civilly, Morally, and add ſome Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and Sprinkling of Religion; will yet come ſhort of Heaven: for, as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. That is, thoſe that mainly cleave to, and Build on the Works of the Law for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are under the Curſe by reaſon of the defects that are in their Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30, 31, 32. <hi>Iſrael that followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs; Wherefore?

So the acts of Natural men may be good, as to the matter of them, as Praying, doing Juſtly with all, yet may be vile as to the Form of them, becauſe all doth flow from a Mercenary Spirit, and is deſigned for their own Honour, and applauſe; or,</p>

So the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did make an Inventory of his Spiritual Riches, and drew up a Catalogue of his Good Works; I am no Extortioner: not Unjuſt, or an Adulterer, or as this <hi>Publican: I Faſt twice a week, I give Tithes of all that I Poſſeſs.</hi> This was the Foundation that he did build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for his acceptance before God; this was his plea at his Bar and Tribunal: ſo that indeed they ſeek Juſtification as it were by the Works of the Law; they give little to Grace, and moſt to Works: theſe are the Foundation of their Confidence, and carry the main ſtroke with them: but <hi>Chriſt</hi> Teacheth us other things; he tells us that when

We are unprofitable ſervants, that is, if God would deal with us according to the defects and Sin that cleaves to our beſt ſervices, he might deal with us as with unprofitable ſervants, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into utter darkneſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Therefore Men muſt not truſt to their own beſt Works, for the obtaining of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance: God doth freely give the Kingdom to his Children; <hi>Fear not little Flock it is your Father's pleaſure to give you the Kingdom, Luke</hi> 12.32.

This Text of Scripture is obſervable, when <hi>Aaron</hi> had offered Sacrifice, then he was to Bleſs the people in the Name of the Lord: the form of Bleſſing is expreſſed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.24, 25, 26. <hi>The Lord make his Face to ſhine, the Lord lift up the light of his Countenance upon thee.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Sacrificed, God hid his Face from him, and did forſake him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings purchaſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured this Bleſſing for us, That God's Face may ſhine on us, and the light of his Countenance may be lifted up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> bare the Curſe, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13. He was made a Curſe, that the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come on us Gentiles, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.14.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41823:93"/>God promiſed to <hi>Abraham, That in his ſeed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be Bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Seed meant and intended, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.8. There could be no Bleſſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Redemption from the Curſe; and we could not be Redeemed from the Curſe, if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did not endure it. There are blemiſhes, and defects in our beſt Works, and they deſerve a Curſe, and therefore cannot earn, and merit a Bleſſing, but we muſt ſeek it in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> they that are of Faith, are Bleſſed with Faithful <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3.9. It is not ſaid they are Bleſſed with working <hi>Abraham,</hi> but with Faithful, believing <hi>Abraham: Abraham</hi> himſelf did not get the Bleſſing by Working, but by believing.

Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord Imputeth not Iniquity.

No man is bleſſed for any Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or works of his own, but as the perſon is a Believer in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and freely Juſtified by Grace, through the Redemption that is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 3.24.

But it is the Forgiveneſs of Sin that is the true cauſe of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs. The Mercies that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows are not conferred by our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as if we had earned, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited them; but by his Covenant, as the Fruits of his meer and pure Grace. Obſerve well this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which God makes between our Covenant, which is a Covenant of Works; and his Covenant, that is a Covenant of Grace; and that Good things are given by his Covenant, but not beſtow'd by our Covenant.

By this Right, this ſeems very properly to be ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Right that was firſt gotten by ſetting the Foot on land, and firſt occupying of it was diſclaimed, diſavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, paſſed over unto another. So Men get a Right in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by laying hand on him, by apprehending of him, as offered by God in the Goſpel, by taking poſſeſſion of him, as given by God, <hi>John</hi> 6.32. <hi>My Father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth you the true Bread from Heaven.</hi> As God gave the Earth to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.16. ſo thoſe that firſt took Poſſeſſion of a Countrey, thereby received God's gift, and got a Right to it; and after Men became
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41823:100"/>Intereſted in Land, there came a Law of God, and Confirmed this Property and Poſſeſſion. God hath forbidden one Man to ſteal from another, to diſ-seize or diveſt him of his Goods, Houſe, Lands. Even ſo when the Soul ſeizes upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as offered, and given by God the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. The Goſpel or Law of Grace Confirms to a Believer an Intereſt, and Inheritance in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> That he that comes to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhall not be caſt out, ſhall not come into Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſhall not Periſh, but have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>John</hi> 3.16.

None out of <hi>Chriſt</hi> can be exempted from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and the Curſe; but we are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.

And how can that be but by imputation, if the Sin of the <hi>Firſt Adam</hi> be imputed to his Children, though they did not then Exiſt? If they were made Sinners by his actual diſobedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 19. Why may not the obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> be imputed to thoſe that are called his Seed? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10.

Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the advantage lies ſo much on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Side: He is a greater perſon than <hi>Adam,</hi> he is God-Man. If the Sin of a meer Man did redound to ſo many Millions to render them guilty, Shall not the obedience and Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> manifeſted in our fleſh, redound to many for their Juſtification. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin was but one ſhort Tranſient act of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, but <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is made up of many acts of Self-Denial, Holineſs, Love to God and Man, and theſe he continued in for his whole life, that was about Thirty three years. Thoſe that are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there is ground for imputing his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs to them; what the Head in the Natural body contrives, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, is imputed to the whole body.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41823:102"/>is the Foundation of God's Juſtifying, or pronouncing us Righteous: God's Judgment is according to truth: God pronounces thoſe Righteous, to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> is made Righteouſneſs, or that are made Righteouſneſs by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19.

He hath given us an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to know him, that is true, <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant juſtifie many,</hi> Iſa. 53.11. that is, many by knowing of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall be Juſtified. Faith is called Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe thoſe that truly know <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> cannot but truſt in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. This is very obſervable, that Chriſtians are ſaid to be Juſtified by the Knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> it is not what we know in our ſelves, or by our ſelves; it is not by the knowledge of what we are, or have done, that we are Juſtified: we muſt purely look off from our ſelves, and wholly fix the eye of Faith on <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Such as know the Inſufficiency of their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the All-ſufficiency of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, do call him, <hi>The Lord</hi> their <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as fly to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> lay hold of him, and do know their own Union
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41823:105"/>with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Relation to him, ſuch will ſay, <hi>Surely in the Lord we have Righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 45.24. A true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever diſclaims, diſavows, and denies Righteouſneſs to be in himſelf; and Glories in this, that he hath Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is not Repentance requiſite, in order to Pardon, Iſa. 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Waſh you, make you clean, put away the euil of your doings, ceaſe to do evll, and learn to do well. Come now, let us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon together, ſaith the Lord: though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they ſhall be as Wooll. He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and forſakes his ſin, ſhall find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> Prov. 28.13. <hi>Let the ſinner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41823:106"/>ſake his ways, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and be will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55.7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Repentance is neceſſary in its place, as an Antecedent, not as a Cauſe, or proper condition of Pardon. Faith precedes, in order of Nature, and Repentance infallibly follows: when we ſee the wonderful Grace of God, that he ſtops, and heales the Breach our Sins have made, with the Dead Body of his Son; quenched the Fire of his Anger with the Blood of his Son: made War with him, to make Peace with us: Sheathed his Sword in his own Son, that he might Draw it out, Sheath it, and for ever lay it aſleep towards us. This Grace of God ſoftens hard Hearts, melts the Rebellious and Obſtinate Wills of Men. When we believe that God will repent of his Righteous Enmity againſt us, this indures, and inclines us to Repent of our unjuſt and wicked Enmity againſt him. When we are perſwaded that God is ready to heal us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.15. this ſwayes us to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41823:106"/>deſiſt from wounding him in his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Glory; when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he will turn from his Anger, this influences ſinners to change their mindes towards God, and to turn from their Provocations, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions againſt him. How can Men poſſibly Love God, or ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, if they Believe he is inexorable, inflexible, will Retain his anger, purſue his Controverſy, and take Vengeance on Offenders for their former Tranſgreſſions? If God will never open his Priſon, if he will ſhut up his Bowels againſt, and pour out his Fury on Tranſgreſſors, this will harden them againſt God. But when they ſee God is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, this cauſes them to relent, and induces them to return to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. God ſaith, <hi>Return ye back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Children, and I will heal your backſlidings.</hi> They Eccho to God, <hi>Lo! we come unto thee, For thou art the Lord our God.</hi> They believed God would forgive Iniquty, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced them to depart from Iniquity. As God puts it away, he will not impute it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. So we muſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41823:107"/>put it away, and not obey it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.16, 17. As God will not remember Iniquity with anger, ſo we muſt not remember it with delight; when God caſts Sin behind his back, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. We muſt ſet no wicked thing before our eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.3. Repentance, in Scripture, is ſaid to be to God, and Faith towards our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Acts</hi> 20.21. By Faith, we firſt return to our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> the great Shepherd, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>laſt.</hi> and then by Repentance we return to God the Father, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. As by Faith we receive the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 5.17. So by Repentance we Recognize the Rights of God; the Dominion he hath over us, as his Creatures, and the advantage he hath againſt us as Sinners. As Faith abaſes us, in that we muſt fly to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Righteouſneſs, ſo Repentance doth lower, ſtoop, and empty us, that we muſt have Recourſe to meer pure Mercy for our Pardon. Faith humbles, as to the matter, for which we are Juſtified, and Repentance humbles us, as to the manner, in which we are Juſtified; as we are
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41823:107"/>Juſtified by the Obedience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo we are alſo Juſtified freely by the Grace of God the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. A Sinner then advances, and magnifies Grace, when he is caſt down in himſelf; when a Sinner ſeeth the Plague of his heart, the Spiritual Leproſy of his Soul, the Filthy Fountain of Iniquity that is in his Nature, he abhors himſelf for the evil Treaſure, that is within, and loathes himſelf for all the evil things that have been brought forth out of it. The offender is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to lift up his Eyes to Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. He bluſhes, and is aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look God in the Face, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.6. Innumerable evils now Compaſs the Sinner about, his Iniquities take hold of him, that he cannot look up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. As we are Juſtified by Faith; ſo we Juſtifie God by Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. 1. In his Commands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12.14. The Commandment is Holy, Juſt, and Good. Holy, with reſpect to God, Juſt, with reſpect to Man; Good, with reſpect to our ſelves. 2. We Juſtifie God in all his threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3, 4. <hi>David</hi> did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41823:108"/>his Iniquity, that God might be Juſtified when he did Speak, and be clear when he did Judg. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God had ſpoken againſt <hi>David,</hi> however he had Judged him and his Houſe by <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10, 11, 12.14. Whatever Judgments he had denounced, as a War to riſe out of his own Houſe, and the defiling of his Wives, the death of his Child, yet <hi>David</hi> doth Juſtifie God in all this: Guilt did ſeale up his Lips, ſhame did cover his Face, he could enter no Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt God, complain of no wrong done by him: If God ſhould cut down Barren Trees, if he ſhould Execute Condemned Creatures, if he ſhould Bury thoſe in the Bottemleſs Pit, that have been long Dead in Sin, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they cannot ſpot him with Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, or blot him with Injuſtice. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is ſo far form leſſening of, or detracting from Grace, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, heightens, and exalts it, that God ſhould Juſtifie a Sinner, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns himſelf, and judges himſelf to be Guilty of Innumerable Tranſgreſſions, and worthy of Eternal Death; that God ſhould cover thoſe Sins in Mercy,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41823:108"/>that were laid open, and repreſented as exceeding Heinous and Sinful, by the Tranſgreſſor himſelf: the poor <hi>Publican</hi> could not plead, but only petition; he could mention no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his within, or good Works without: he had nothing to look, or fly to, but Mercy only. <hi>God be Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me a Sinner.</hi> It is obſervable, he doth not ſay, My God be merciful to me a Sinner, but <hi>God be Merciful to me a Sinner. Adam</hi> accuſed <hi>Eve, Eve</hi> accuſed the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and ſo thought in ſome meaſure to excuſe themſelves; but the <hi>Publican</hi> charged himſelf only; I am the Sinner: he accuſes no other: though Sinning, yet preſumptous <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaith, <hi>My God we know thee, Hoſ.</hi> 8.2. But this <hi>Publican</hi> pleads no relation to God, claims no Intereſt in him, yet he ventures to caſt himſelf into the Arms of Mercy; to lye down proſtrate at the feet of Mercy. And was not this Free and Rich Grace, to cleanſe a Spiritual Leper, to waſh one that accounts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Lump of Guilt and Filth? To bind up a broken heart, to Raiſe a Spirit bowed down, and ready utterly to ſink under a weight of Guilt? To
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41823:109"/>take away Filthy garments, and to bring forth the beſt Robe? to Cloath a naked Soul, to kill the fatted Calf to Feaſt a Famiſhing Sinner? If the very Redemption of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning Sacrifice doth not detract from God's Free Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24.

                     </note> Surely the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a Broken Heart doth not Wrong, or Rob Grace of its glory; it was the expreſs will and Law of God, that on the very day of Attonement, when Sacrifices were offered for Typical Expiation of Sin, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> afflict their Souls, <hi>Levet.</hi> 16.29. Much more when we Beleive that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath made a real Attonement for our Sins, we muſt deeply afflict our Souls for our Iniquities, that kindled the Wrath of God againſt us; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſo bitter a Cup for, and pluck ſo Heavy a Burden on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to ſo grievous a ſtorm and Tempeſt of Divine Vengeance: That ſhould not be ſweet to us, that was ſo bitter to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> That ſhould not be Light to us, that lay ſo Heavy on <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Did God forſake his Son? <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:41823:109"/>22.1. And ſhall not we forſake our ſins? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. The Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> purgeth Conſcience <hi>from dead works,</hi> Heb. 9.14. yet with our Faith in this Blood we muſt joyn Repentance from dead works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. As a Guilty, ſo alſo a Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Conſcience muſt be purged away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. yet here we muſt be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Repentance doth not intereſt us in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, neither doth it earn, or deſerve Pardon. As <hi>Moſes</hi> turned the Waters of <hi>Egypt</hi> into Blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.19. ſo the Law would turn our very Tents into Blood if there were not a Mediator, and a New Gracious Covenant. Repentance is the Gift of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. If this Gift doth oblige us to God, Can the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it Indebt God to us? We are not Juſtified by, or for our Repentance, we ſhall greatly miſtake, if we think that Repentance, and New Obedience, do come in the Room and place of a Perfect Legal Righteouſneſs, by Divine Acceptance: but only the wiſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God hath ſo ordained it, that there ſhall be an Order in diſpoſing of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the New Covenant. God gives Faith and Repentance firſt to prepare Men to receive other Benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41823:110"/>One Grace makes way for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God ſtrikes the Rocky hearts of Sinners, and breaks them: he turns the Flint into a Fountain of Water, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114. <hi>laſt.</hi> And when God hath broken the Hard heart, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> binds up the Broken heart, and drops in the precious Balſom of his Blood, by wounding Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with his Arrows, and the Sword of his Word, he prepares them to be his Patients, and doth a Cure on them. Men muſt be Mourners firſt, before <hi>Chriſt</hi> can comfort them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. they muſt become Guilty in their own eyes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. and confeſs God's Actions to be Juſt, and his Indictments to be True, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth purge their Conſciences, and roll away their Guilt. When the Sinner is Plowed with the Spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> Sows it with the Seed of his Righteouſneſs, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Pardon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> A great Objection is raiſed from <hi>James</hi> his Doctrine and words, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that I have aſſerted, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jehovah</hi> his being <hi>our Righteouſneſs,</hi> and our being Juſtified by his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. <hi>Was not Abraham our Father juſtified by Works, when he offered up Iſaac?</hi> James 2.21. <hi>Was not Rahab the Harlot
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41823:110"/>juſtified by works, when ſhe received the Meſſengers, and ſent them out another way,</hi> James 2.25. Again, in the 24th <hi>v.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Ye ſee then, how that by works a Man is juſtified, and not by Faith only.</hi> Doth not <hi>James</hi> ſeem to contradict <hi>Paul?</hi> Rom. 4.9. <hi>We ſay that Faith was reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Abraham for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4.2. <hi>If Abraham were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God:</hi> that is, <hi>Abraham</hi> hath not Righteouſneſs of his own, or Works done by himſelf, to glory in before God; therefore he cannot be Juſtified by Works. To him that worketh not, but Believeth on him that Juſtifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs. God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth Righteouſneſs without Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6. To this Objection I ſhall Anſwer many things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the ſeveral ſorts of Perſons that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> had to do with; <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe is bent againſt proud Juſticiaries, that thought to build up a Righteouſneſs of their own; by which they deſigned both to adorn themſelves in the eye of God's Holineſs, and to ſecure themſelves from the Sword of his Juſtice. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> Teacheth, that no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41823:111"/>of Man can weigh in God's Balance, or is pleadable at the Bar of Juſtice. We are all as an unclean thing, and our Righteouſneſſes are but as filthy rags. <hi>By the deeds of the Law ſhall no fleſh living be Juſtified,</hi> Rom. 3.20.21. Our Works before Regeneration are all as Braſs Money: our Works after Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration are as Mixt Mettal: therefore neither of them both will pay our Rent of Obedience, or ſatisfie our Great Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord. But <hi>James</hi> hath to do with Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſelf-deceiving Hypocrites, that pretend to Faith, but it is a barren, idle, dead Faith. They did ſay they had Faith, but they had no Works, <hi>James</hi> 2.14. they could not ſhew, or evidence their Faith, becauſe they had no Works. As the Body, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, without breathing, is dead, <hi>James</hi> 2.18. ſo is Faith, if it doth not breath in Works. <hi>James</hi> his deſign was, to ſhame, confound, and ſilence theſe Hypocrites, and to demonſtrate, that they had no true Faith at all, but did graſp a Lie, and hug an Idol of their own, inſtead of True Faith. Strong Faith in <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſhew it ſelf, in Offering up <hi>Iſaac, James</hi> 2.21. and weak Faith in <hi>Rahab</hi> did diſcover it ſelf, in aiding the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiſh</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:41823:111"/>Spies, and ſending them ſafe away, though this might have proved dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to her own Life, <hi>James</hi> 2.25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of Faith, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, and builds, and is acted only on this before God; <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of Faith, as it is to come forth, and to be demonſtrated before Men. <hi>Luther</hi> compares Faith to a Queen, that is in the Bride-chamber alone with <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Bridegroom. But as this Queen comes forth, and walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad before Men, ſo it is attended with many Good Works, that are its Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, that wait on it: it is Faith alone that Juſtifieth, but yet that Faith that Juſtifieth is not ſolitary, or alone, but always is fruitful in Good Works, and hath influence on the whole Life, to guide and direct it by the Light of God's Word. <hi>The life that I live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> Galat. 2.20. Faith animates the very Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life, and runs through all the acts and parts of it, and ſo ſubordinates them to God's Will, and refers them all to his Glory. <hi>Luther</hi> ſays, Faith ſweeps the Houſe, and Milks the Goats.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Juſtification that <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, is not a Juſtification of the Perſon,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41823:112"/>but of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and integrity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy Son, thy onely Son from me:</hi> Not that God acquired any new knowledge that he had not before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Abraham;</hi> but it is an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which God condeſcends to our weakneſs; and intimates, that if God had not known <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity before, this Illuſtrious Fact, this Eminent Self-denying Obedience of <hi>Abraham,</hi> would evidently, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly prove the Truth of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, and the ſincerity of his heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. When <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſhew ſuch readineſs to offer up his Son, the Scripture was then fulfilled, <hi>That A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham believed God, and that it was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that the Scripture had tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, his Faith wrought with his Works, to evidence him a ſincere Believer; and his Faith was made perfect by his Works, that is, it was provided to be genuine, the ſtrength and power of it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as God's ſtrength is ſaid to be made perfect in weakneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. that is diſcovered to be perfect.</p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:41823:112"/>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the cauſes of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he ſearches after the Springs of it, <hi>viz. Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, and Faith as receiving it; but <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of the effects of Juſtification. A Man whoſe Perſon is Juſtified before God, will certainly Juſtifie his Faith, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity before Men, by Works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Juſtification of a Sinner; <hi>James</hi> Treats of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of a Believer. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Righteouſneſs that muſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt; James</hi> Treats of the Faith that muſt Juſtifie, of what kind, and ſort it muſt be, not an Idle, Lazy, but a Working Faith. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>James,</hi> of Juſtification before Men, <hi>James</hi> 2.18. <hi>Shew me thy Faith;</hi> prove it, if thou canſt, to be a right Faith, if it bring not forth Good Works.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That <hi>James</hi> doth not ſpeak of a proper Juſtification of the Perſon of a Man before God by Works, is evident by ſeveral Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The proper Juſtification of a Man is from Sins, that he hath done, not for Works of Righteouſneſs that he hath
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41823:113"/>wrought: Good Works are not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God's Tribunal; but Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are Covered, Pſal. 32.1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> By <hi>Chriſt</hi> we have forgiveneſs of Sin, and are Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all things, from which we could not be Juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> So that a Goſpel Juſtification is a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us not from a falſe Charge, but from a true Accuſation. Our Conſciences do accuſe, convince, and condemn us for ſin, <hi>John</hi> 8.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>We know our Tranſgreſſions, they are with us,</hi> Iſa. 59.12. but there is no ſuch charge of Hypocriſie that lies before God againſt true Believers, and Saints. They can appeal to God, as <hi>Job, Job</hi> 10.7. <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I am not wicked. My witneſs is in Heaven, my Record is on high,</hi> Job 16.19. <hi>Thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> John 21.17.

                  <p n="2">2. Nothing will properly Juſtifie us, but what is Commenſurate to the demands of the Law, and that which will ſatisfie the Juſtice of God. But there is no Obedience of ours that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers

Nothing will properly Juſtifie us, but that which did Juſtifie <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> he could not be Juſtified except he had been fully conformable to the Commands of the Law, and endured the Curſe alſo.

                  <p n="4">4. In a proper Juſtification we are Juſtified before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 21. But our own Works cannot be imputed to us for a Righteouſneſs before God, becauſe he ſeeth ſo many Faults, Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, and Defects in them, <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, there are no pure Elements, for they are mixed one with another and Divines

                  <p n="6">6. If we could be Juſtified by our Good works, we ſhould Juſtifie our ſelves; but it is God's act, and not ours to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, <hi>It is God that Juſtifieth, Rom.</hi> 8.33.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In a true Juſtification, we receive a Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. And an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. But our Works cannot make an Attonement for us, or be a Righteouſneſs to us.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Works both before, and after Faith, are ſhut out from Juſtification before Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22. The Righteouſneſs of God is Manifeſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> not only ſuffered loſs of all that he accounted his gain, while a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> but alſo after he was Converted; he <hi>Eſteemed all but

                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf had not whereof to boaſt, or wherein to Glory before God: He could not find ſuch a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in his Heart, or ſuch Works in his Life, that he durſt to truſt to. <hi>Hath Abraham our Father found as touching the Fleſh, Rom.</hi> 4.1. No ſurely, he did not find any Righteouſneſs or Works of his own to plead before God. Therefore he that cannot find this Righteouſneſs in himſelf, had need to be found in <hi>Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.9. Though <hi>Moſes</hi> was Eminently Holy, yet when he drew near to God, and ſaw that Terible Glory that appeared in the Mount; he ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly Fear, and Quake, Heb.</hi> 12.21. He could not ſtand before the Law that he gave. Saints have waved a Trial before God on the account of Works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. Though <hi>David</hi> was the Lord's ſervant, though he did ſet the Judgments of God before him, and was devoted to his Fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.30, 38. yet he deprecated a Trial before God on the account of his own Righteouſneſs: <hi>Enter not Lord into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thy Servant.</hi> Why doth he pray ſo much againſt God's entring into
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41823:115"/>Judgement with him? The reaſon he gives is ſtrong, <hi>For in thy ſight ſhall no Man Living be Juſtified.</hi> For by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 21. The Law was not given to Fallen Men to Juſtifie them, but to diſcover their Sins. By the Law comes nothing elſe to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Man, but the Knowledge of Sin: it allows ſuch no Good Works at all. If the Law once diſcovers Sin in Men, farewel a Juſtification by the Law for ever. Faith cannot Juſtifie it ſelf, it is ſo weak, and accompanied with ſuch doubts, ſtaggerings, and fears; And how ſhall Works Juſtifie themſelves, that have ſuch defects and defilements cleaving to them: Obſerve theſe four Weighty Queſtions propoſed in the Scripture, 1. <hi>The Heart is deceitful, and deſperately wicked, Who can know it?</hi> Jer. 17 9.2. <hi>Who can ſay I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi> Prov. 20.9.3. <hi>Who can underſtand his errours?</hi> Pſal. 19.12.4. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhould mark Iniquity, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> Pſal. 130.3, 4. Though Saints, as <hi>Job,</hi> in their pleadings with Men, held faſt their Integrity, <hi>Job</hi> 27.6. yet they have let go all confidence in their own Works, in their approaches to God:

                     <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and our Righteouſneſſes are but Filthy rags,</hi> Iſa. 64.6.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Abraham</hi> was long before he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up <hi>Iſaac</hi> a Beleiver and a Juſtified perſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Abraham</hi> Believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for Righteouſneſs: it is very obſervable that we have no mention or Record made of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith and Juſtification till now, though he was called effectually near Twenty years before: And why is the mention of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith and Juſtification reſerved till now? I anſwer, God now promiſes him, that the Son that ſhould come out of his own Bowels, ſhould be his Heir, and that from this Son ſhould Spring a Seed as Numerous as the Stars of Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.45. And in <hi>Iſaac</hi> Chriſt was Typified, and promiſed: as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a Child Raiſed from the dead body of aged <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the dead womb of old Barren <hi>Sarah;</hi> ſo <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be raiſed from the Dead; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels theſe two things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19.24. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s day, in the Promiſe, and Birth of <hi>Iſaac, John</hi> 8.56. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was exceeding proper for <hi>Moſes</hi> then to record <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith in God, when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was promiſed, by whom
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41823:116"/>we Believe in God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. As <hi>Abraham</hi> could not Believe in God, but by the Promiſed Seed; ſo we could not be Juſtified, but through <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now, Would <hi>Abraham</hi> go from truſting in the perfect Righteouſneſs of the promiſed Seed, to truſt in his own defective Works, and imperfect Righteouſneſs? Certain it is, that there is but one way of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Righteouſneſs of God is Revealed from Faith to Faith, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.17. It is not from Faith to Works; but Faith at firſt, and all along, and at laſt apprehends this Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and builds on it; Therefore the Juſt is ſaid to live by Faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Believer, and Juſtified at his firſt effectual call; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> Teſtifies, that many years after he Believed in God, and he counted it to him for Righteouſneſs: ſo that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Faith acted on God through the promiſed Seed, from firſt to laſt for Juſtification. Here the Apoſtle might take ground for his aſſertion; that the Righteouſneſs of God was revealed from Faith to Faith. Did <hi>Abraham</hi> begin in the Spirit, as to his Juſtification, and would he after this reſort and repair to the Fleſh to be perfected? Did the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> begin his
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41823:116"/>Juſtification, and was his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to compleat it? What would this be but to go from a Son of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. to a candle of Righteouſneſs? From a compleat ſhip to a broken plank: From a beautiful and glorious garment to a Filthy Rag, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. From a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice, to ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lothſom Dung, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To aſſert a Second Juſtification before God by Works; What is it but to confound the two Covenants, to blend the Covenant of Works, and Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to form up a Baſtard-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that is not purely of Grace, or wholy of Works, but mixed, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of both; which the Scripture diſ-claims as inconſiſtent? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. As <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> could not quietly Dwell, or peaceably abide together in one Family. <hi>Hagar</hi> diſpiſed <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 16.4. and <hi>Iſmael</hi> mocked at <hi>Iſaac.

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Firſt Adam</hi>'s Sin is imputed to us; yet it is not true, that we are as Great and Heinous Sinners as the <hi>Firſt Adam.</hi> We did not Exiſt in our own Perſons as he did: We did not receive a Law from God Immediately as he did; or were in our own perſons inveſted with a Lordſhip over all the Creatures, and placed in Paradiſe, as he was; he was a publick, but we are particular, and private perſons, he Sinned in his own perſon, we but in him. Therefore, though his Sin be imputed to us, yet his guilt was greater than ours: This parallel between
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41823:117"/>the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second Adam</hi> may ſomewhat anſwer the <hi>Objection.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Author, and Subject of this Righteouſneſs; but we are neither; only it is imputed to us, and beſtowed on us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is not imputed to us according to its full Value; but our particular neceſſity, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Jewel given for the Redemption of a hundred Captives: None of them hath the whole Jewel given for him, but it is given for every one of the hundred Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, according to his particular Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to obtain his liberty.

The Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted our intrinſick Righteouſneſs, ſo indeed we ſhould be Reputed Saviours. It is imputed to us not according to its univerſal value, but according to our particular neceſſity, that we by it may be accounted Righteous. It is imputed to us as the ſubjects have benefit by it,

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Aſſertion, that we may be perfect in this Life, is moſt falſe, and expreſly contradicts the Scripture, <hi>That there is not a Juſt Man on Earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.20. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us,</hi> 1 John 1.8. We cannot ſay we have no ſin, for we have Original ſin yet remaining, and dwelling in us. The Leproſy of ſin is not perfectly purged out of us, till the Houſe of the Body is pulled down: How elſe could it be ſaid, <hi>That the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is dead by reaſon of ſin?</hi> Rom. 9.10. If we were perfect, how could we die? Doth it ſute the Juſtice of God to pull and tare a perfect Creature in pieces, and to deliver it up to Corruption? If there be no ſin within, what is that which opens the Door, and lets in Death? If there be no Bonds of ſin on
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41823:118"/>the Soul, how doth the Bondage of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption come on the Body? God hath wiſely ordered it, that Perſons ſhall not come to the Mark of Perfection, till they alſo arrive at the Prize of Glory. How Fooliſh and Falſe is it for Perſons to ſay they are perfect, and yet have not attained to the Prize of Glory, but are in a frail and miſerable Eſtate? God deſigns not that Perſons ſhall be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect in a Natural Body. 1. That the Threatning may be fulfilled, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen. 3.19. 2. That Chriſtians may have an Enemy to Wreſtle and Conflict with whilſt they are here, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. 3. That Believers may ſtill act Faith on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and repair to him for Help, Healing and Salvation.

The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.1. thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf to the <hi>Galatians; O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41823:119"/>Galatians! Who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth? before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth as Crucified.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and others, had drawn the Picture of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified, in beautiful and lively Colours; he had deſcribed the Cauſes, the Ends, the Greatneſs and Grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings; and he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that any ſhould darken their Minds, and, as it were, bewitch their Eyes, that they ſhould not ſee the Lovelineſs, and Excellency of this Glorious Object, and comply with the Ends and Deſigns of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death. Would <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſtoop ſo low? Would he endure ſuch hard, and heavy things, to have only a ſhare in our Juſtification? Shall any put in a joynt-ſtock with <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Shall they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their own Redemption and Juſtification? Will <hi>Chriſt</hi> be a Partner only with our Works and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Shall a Crown be put on the head of the Creature, as well as one ſet on the Head of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Is this the utmoſt product of all <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s bitter Sufferings, to do but half in our Juſtification? Will not a Man both deceive, and indanger himſelf, that ſets one Foot on a ſtrong Bough, and another on a rotten one?
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41823:119"/>Will not ſuch an one fall? So he that leans on <hi>Chriſt</hi> in part, and on his own Righteouſneſs in part, will be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſappointed; will miſcarry and periſh: The Church is thus deſcribed, as leaning on her Beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.5. It is this Arm only that can ſupport us, and it is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs that muſt keep us from ſinking into Deſtruction. How ignorant are Men of their Sins, if they think theſe Waters are not ſo deep, but they can Wade through them, and not need <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as an Ark, to carry them over? How blind are they, that think, their Wounds are not ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but they can heal them? or that Judge, their Tranſgreſſions are not ſo heavy, but they can caſt in Religious Duties and Good Works enough to fetch up the Scale from the Ground, and make a Compenſation for their Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to Ranſom themſelves from Deſtruction? The Papiſts here are highly guilty of darkening this Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of Robbing him of the Honour of it: they aſſert, that a Man may do ſuch Good Works before Juſtification, that render it meet that God ſhould give him Grace; and that by Good Works done after Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41823:120"/>he may Merit Glory. They affirm, that we are Juſtified, not by Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or not imputing our Treſpaſſes, as the Scripture ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. but by the infuſion of Righteouſneſs into us. <hi>Alenſis</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Juſtificatio eſt rectitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do liberi arbitrii;</hi> that is, it is the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Rectifying of Man's Free-will; the bringing of the Soul to love God. But this is a proud and falſe Doctrine in this (as well as other Senſes) <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Egypt,</hi> Revel. 11.8. as it aſſerts a River of Inherent Righteouſneſs below, and that they need not that God ſhould Rain an Imputed Righteouſneſs on them, as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaid of the Ground, and Herbs of <hi>Egypt, Nec pluvio ſupplicat Herba Jovi:</hi> their Ground and Herbs did not Pray to <hi>Jupiter</hi> to ſend Rain. A part of <hi>Egypt</hi> is ſatisfied with the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and hath no Rain, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures teach us, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.18. They think to climb to Heaven by a proud <hi>Babel</hi> of their own Building, and not to aſcend thither by the Ladder of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs. As this is a proud, ſo it is a falſe Doctrine. 1. It deſtroys the Parallel that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes between <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being made Sin, and our being made Righeouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:41823:120"/>5.21. as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made ſin, though he had not Inherent ſin, but only our ſins Imputed to him, ſo we are made Righteouſneſs, by the Imputation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs to us, though we have not a perfect Inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nothing Juſtifies before God but a Perfect Obedience and Righteouſneſs; our own, at beſt, is not ſuch, therefore we need <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as applying himſelf to us, is the efficient cauſe of our Righteouſneſs, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as applied, is the formal cauſe of it, as <hi>Ameſius</hi> in his <hi>[Bellarminus enervatus]</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently aſſerts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we are Juſtified by an Inherent Righteouſneſs of our own, there would be no room, pretence, or colour, for that Objection, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all Natural Men are ready to make againſt the Doctrine of Juſtification. Shall we not ſin then, that Grace may abound? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. If God Juſtifies by pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſins, and not imputing our Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, then, the more we offend, then the more Glory Grace will have in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving our Iniquities, and ſo we may let the Reins looſe to our Luſts. But if <hi>Paul</hi> did aſſert our Juſtification to be
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41823:121"/>by infuſing of Righteouſneſs into us, the more Righteouſneſs is Infuſed into us, the more we ſhould be reſtrained from ſin, and the leſs need Mercy to Pardon our ſins; and there would be no colour for ſuch an Objection as the <hi>Jews</hi> did raiſe from the Apoſtle's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are others that we own as Brethren, and account as ſound in the main of the Doctrine of Juſtification, yet we may modeſtly enquire, whether ſome of their notions, or expreſſions, are calculated to advance the Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs in the Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ungodly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They aſſert that Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are proper conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and of our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Condition, properly taken, is Influential into Right; if performed, it giveth Right unto the benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; if not performed, there is no Right: and therefore is a cauſe, (ſaith Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> in his opening of the Old and New Covenant, <hi>Page</hi> 216.) Faith (as he ſaith) giveth no Right, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. It receives <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in him a Right and Title to the Bleſſings of the Covenant; but it doth not give
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41823:121"/>one. Faith is not reckoned the leaſt of that Righteouſneſs, whereby we are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; but a means for the Applying of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who is our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Covenant, as to that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, Juſtification, is not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, as to be without all means, yet may be abſolute, without any condition, properly ſo called

Believing doth not now take the place of doing in the Old Covenant, for then it muſt be our Righteouſneſs unto Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; whereas that which Juſtifieth, is called the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. therefore Faith is diſtinct from that Righteouſneſs it ſelf, and is not the leaſt Atom of it

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not our Believing, but the Obedience of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is that which cometh in the Room, and Stead, of that doing for Life intended in the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Chriſt is the Lord our Righteouſneſs;</hi> but to note, that it lieth wholly out of our ſelves, that it is not by any of our performances, but in another, even in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it is ſaid to be by Faith, as a means of Application. Faith (though
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41823:122"/>neceſſary) doth receive a Title from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> doth not give one.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 201.</note> We do not claim Salvation in the Right of any act of ours, not upon the Rent of Faith—we hold and claim upon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> alone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19, 21. If Faith be a proper condition, and not an inſtrument, let it be conſidered. 1. Whether we are not then Juſtified by Faith as a work. Now the Scripture diſtinguiſheth, and oppoſeth Working and Believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. Therefore ſurely Faith is not conſidered as a Work in Juſtification. In a condition, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and perfection of the Work is properly to be attended to, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument reſpects the Excellency of the object; hence a weak Faith Juſtifies as much as a ſtrong Faith, becauſe we are not Juſtified by our own act, but by the object that we look to. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Antidote againſt the 6th Seſſion of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Neque et enim quicquam noſtrum fides affert ad Deum, ſed, quod ultro affert nobis Deus, recipit.</hi> Faith brings nothing of ours to God, but only receives what he offers: hence, ſaith he it is, that Faith, though imperfect, doth poſſeſs a perfect Righteouſneſs;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41823:122"/>becauſe it hath no other reſpect but to the free Goodneſs of God. 2. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is properly to be done before we have a Right to the benefit promiſed; but Faith receives <hi>Chriſt</hi> immediately, and feeds on him. In our very Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, we are put into Poſſeſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and have the Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12.3. To have a Right, is a leſs benefit than we have by Faith; for a Man may have a Right, and not have Poſſeſſion, but be put to ſue it: but by Faith we receive the Teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 1.32, 33. 1 <hi>John</hi> 12.4. That which is promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, cannot properly be a condition of the Covenant. In thoſe words, <hi>They ſhall all know me from the greateſt to the leaſt:</hi> Faith ſeems to be promiſed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. Faith is a manner of knowing of things upon the Teſtimony of another, and Faith ſeems to be called Knowledge, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. Beſides, it ſeems too high a thing for us, thus to plead with God; Lord, we have performed the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore juſtly claim the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit as due to us. Surely it ſeems <hi>moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for us, and moſt for the Glory of God's Grace, and of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, that Faith ſhould be conſidered rather as
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41823:123"/>a Beggar's hand, than as a Working hand: the hand Faith is not a Working hand to earn and gain a Righteouſneſs; but a Beggar's hand to receive a gift: we are ſaid to receive the Teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt, John</hi> 3.33. to receive <hi>Chriſt, John</hi> 1.12. To receive Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. To receive the Atonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. To receive the remiſſion of Sins, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. All theſe Expreſſions ſeem to point at Faith, as an Inſtrument rather than as a condition; We receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our Righteouſneſs, as our Food, as our Ranſom, as our Medicine, in the firſt direct acts of Faith: theſe things do not come after believing, but are received in, and by Believing, as a Beggar makes an Alms his own by receiving it.</p>
                  <p>And though we own a contrite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinner to be the ſubject of Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification; yet we cannot own that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance doth receive the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this belongs to Faith alone, or that Repentance is a condition that puts any worth into us, as our act of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but rather that God requires it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it empties, impoveriſhes, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drives us out of our ſelves to God's free mercy, and to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Atoneing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41823:123"/>Sacrifice: God requires a broken Heart, not for any worth in the matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, but becauſe, by contrition, all conceits of ſelf-worthineſs are expelled, and the contrite man renounceth his own Works, worth, and merit, and deſpiſeth his own doings as a broken Veſſel. Such an one is moſt fit to receive the Grace, and free pardon of God, as Mr. <hi>Dickſon</hi> well expreſſeth it on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. A Malefactor, though never ſo Penitent, is not thereby qualified to be Juſtified from that Capital Crime he hath committed; but if juſt compenſation be made, and full Satisfaction be given to the Law (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done) this may be pleaded to prevent Death. Repentance is alſo promiſed in the Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give to you, and a new Spirit will I put within you: I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Heart of Stone, and give you a Heart of Fleſh,</hi> and therefore cannot be a proper condition of the Covenant of Grace. Faith and Repentance in their own Nature, do both renounce themſelves, as Righteouſneſs, or qualifications to make us meet to be Juſtified; the Obedience that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a ſurety, hath performed, is the proper condition on which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is built: Hath <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:41823:124"/>performed the perfect condition of the new Covenant, and yet ſet up imperfect ones to be performed by us, to give us a right to the Covenant and its Bleſſings?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some Brethren do inlarge the object of Juſtifying Faith, and make <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> as well as <hi>Prieſt,</hi> the Object of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith; or that we muſt receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>King</hi> as well as <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We own that the Faith that Juſtifieth, doth receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>King;</hi> but we deny that it cloſeth with <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> as it is Juſtifying. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> ſubdues us to God, mortifies our Luſts, writes his Laws in our Hearts; but theſe things relate to our Sanctification, not to our Juſtification. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Prieſt</hi> only, hath a proper influence on our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as ſuch; he was made under the Command, and endured the Curſe of the Law. The taking of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for our <hi>Lord,</hi> the chooſing, and accepting of him as our <hi>King,</hi> is the root, ſpring, and begining of our new Obedience. Our very Subjection to <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an imperfect and a defective act of Obedience; we do not fully Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> There is a Negative vote, there is a Rebellious party; there is a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41823:124"/>Law of Sin in our Fleſh. And can we look on a weak imperfect act of our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as giving us right and title to the perfect Obedience, and compleat Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Chooſing and taking <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>King</hi> is certainly a work of ours; and if we are Juſtified by it, as a condition, Are we not Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Work of our own? Is not this to bring in our Works in the root and principle of them into Juſtification? And muſt we not beware, that though we have Works in our Superſtructure, yet we have them not in our Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some ſet up that, which they call an Evangelical Righteouſneſs of our own, conſiſting in the fulfilling the conditions of the new Law, or Covenant; and that it is this that entitles us to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which they call our Legal Righteouſneſs: Our Brethren (I hope) do not mean that our own Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteouſneſs is our immediate Righteouſneſs, and the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our remote Righteouſneſs. Surely <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is our immediate, only perfect Righteouſneſs for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By a new Law, I hope, they do not mean, a Law that requires leſs duty than
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41823:125"/>the Moral Law, or makes thoſe imperfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to be no Sins that the Moral Law doth condemn as <hi>Tranſgreſſions.</hi> All our new Obedience cannot be any proper condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant becauſe the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it is the Fruit of God's perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his promiſe to us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit into them, and cauſe them to walk in my Statutes, and to keep my Judgements and Commandments.</hi> Our Obedience is defective, and imperfect; And can this be the condition of our Title to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs?

                  <p n="1">1. Of the wonderful wiſdom. 2. Of the exact Righteouſneſs. 3. Of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Grace of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may learn the wonderful wiſdom of God, that he hath Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led two things, that ſeemed contrary, and utterly inconſiſtent. That the Juſt ſhould be Condemned, and the Wicked Juſtified, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. yet both theſe God hath accompliſhed without any ſtain to his Holineſs, reflexion on, or reproach to his Juſtice. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41823:125"/>knew no ſin, yet was made ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. that Juſt one died for the Unjuſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. What was more remote from the thoughts, and hid from the minds of Natural Men, than that the Son of God ſhould ſtoop from Heaven to Earth, be not only clothed with our Fleſh, but alſo be burthened with our Sins, and the weight of our Curſe: That he ſhould come under our Iniquities, that we might come into his Righteouſneſs. The very finding out a Surety, and the conſtituting of a Mediator, is a deep deſign of Infinite Wiſdom: That ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould expiate our ſins, and pay a Ranſom for our Souls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may be informed of the exact Righteouſneſs, and inexorable Juſtice of God; How juſt is God, that he would not be appeaſed without an Atoning Sacrifice? that he would not diſmiſs Priſoners, or releaſe Captives without a Ranſom, or Juſtifie without an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. The Debt muſt be exacted of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Storm muſt fall, the Curſe muſt be executed on him, elſe he could not be <hi>our Righteouſneſs.

Our Sins were laid on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities took hold of him, our Reproaches, whereby we reproached God, did fall on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 15.3. he could not be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Cup could not paſs from him: God could not releaſe, or exempt his own Son from Sufferings. The Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was ſo bound, by his own underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as a Surety, that he could not uſe his own Tongue to plead for, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf: he could not exert, or exerciſe his own power to reſtrain his Enemies, or to reſcue himſelf from them. It was juſt that God ſhould bruiſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he became our Surety; it is now juſt that God ſhould Pardon thoſe that fly to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 1.9. There was a Redemption of Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 9.15.

But <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Supernatural Head, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> conſtituted by meer Grace. We were wholly ſtrangers, and no way Related to him but by pure Mercy. His Righteouſneſs is wholy a Gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. We were born under <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin; but it is by Faith that we come into <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs. Guilt is ſpoken of as that which is paſt: <hi>By the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of one many have been made ſinners;</hi> but Juſtification is ſpoken of as Future,

                     <hi>By the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.19. that is, when they fly to him, and are found in him. O what Grace is this that ſinners ſhould be cut out of their Natural Stock, and be grafted into a Supernatural Stock? that we ſhould not be condemned for our own ſins, but be juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of another. That God ſhould Rain Vengeance on him, and Righteouſneſs on us.

So every Juſtified Sinner is firſt without the Law: he is alive, and full of hopes, becauſe he is without the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. he knows not the Spirituality of the Commands of the Law, nor the Severity of its Threatnings; he hath a Calm, and Peace, becauſe he never imputed his Numerous ſins to himſelf, or bound his Heinous Iniquities on himſelf.

Conſcience is now loaded with dead Works, yet ſtupid Sinners do not feel it; a Mountain of Guilt is upon them, yet they are not ſenſible of it.

When the Wall of our Innocency is broken, we are expoſed to the Inrodes and Invaſions of Revenging Juſtice.

And he hath by one Offering for ever perfected us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. There is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidence and demonſtration, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath finiſhed his Work; for he could not elſe have confidently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and committed his Soul to his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.46. He would not elſe have been welcome to him, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him, <hi>John</hi> 16.10. The World was to be convinced of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by this argument, that he did go to the Father, and they did ſee him no more on Earth: How could he have ventured into the glorious Preſence of God, if he had not Righteouſly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he undertook?

But <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, ſhould be ſeen on Earth no more in the form of a Servant, to do any Work in a ſtate of Humiliation. 2. The Father Raiſed him up from the Dead, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.

This was an Officer from the great Judge of Heaven and Earth, to free our ſurety, and to evidence, that God was ſatisfied, and did allow <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. 3.

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:41823:146"/>thee with <hi>Manna,</hi> which thou kneweſt not, neither did thy Fathers know; when they found it, and ſaw it firſt on the ground, they wondered, and cried out, <hi>What is this?</hi> Exod. 16.4. So the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin renders the word very properly, and this is moſt ſuitable to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words; <hi>for they wiſt not what it was.</hi> To ſay, they called it <hi>Manna,</hi> for they wiſt not what it was, is not ſo good, and fit a ſenſe. Some have conceived, that the phraſe, <hi>hidden Manna,</hi> was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Queſtion, and Ignorance of <hi>Manna;</hi> indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> were, and all Natural Men are ignorant of the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. The Wrath of God is indeed reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven to all Men by Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providences, Deſolating Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments, as War, Famin, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Inundations and Earthquakes; but the Righteouſneſs of God is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel. God might have ſtopt in the Revelation of his Wrath, and have gone no farther: but he hath proceeded to reveal his Righteouſneſs in the Goſpel, that he is Juſt, and the Juſtifier of them that believe in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3.25, 26. The Fountain is now opened, in which we muſt waſh; the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41823:146"/>Ranſom is now paid, for which we muſt be Releaſed; the Obedience is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by which we muſt be Juſtified; The Sun of Righteouſneſs is now riſen with Healing under his Wings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. The glorious beams of this Sun of Righteouſneſs diſpels not only the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Miſts of leſſer Sins, but the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Clouds of Heinous Iniquities, that not only hide the Light of God's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from us, but would pour down a ſtorm of Vengeance upon us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Goſpel is the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in ſprinkling Nations with the dew of the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. <hi>laſt.</hi> he doth alſo ſprinkle them with the drops of his Blood. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is Juſtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.8. and ſo in a full capacity to Juſtifie us; and that becauſe he hath born our Iniquities, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11.

                  <p n="3">3. Conſider the Excellency of this Righteouſneſs, it is clean water to waſh
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41823:147"/>us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. It is clean Linen to adorn us, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.8.

A Candle waſtes and conſumes, but ſo doth not the Sun. So this Sun of Righteouſneſs will never decay, or loſe his light and glory. The Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſtill freſh, he appeares, even now, as if he had been but a Lamb lately ſlain, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.6. And becauſe his Blood is ſtill ſo freſh, and the virtue of it ſo laſting, therefore the Redemption that flows from it is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. But more particularly I ſhall ſet forth the excellency of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, and the pretiouſneſs of his Sacrifice in theſe Following propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>'s Obedience, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, was one whole entire piece; it was a continual Series of Holy acts,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41823:147"/>without any interuption: our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is made up of patches, and pieces; there are interuptions in our obedience, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> obey'd during his whole Life, and at laſt became obedient to the Death of the Croſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. As Oxen of old did draw in the Yoke, and at laſt were Offered in Sacrifice. 2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> did neither ſtop or pauſe in his Work, or ſtray at all from his way, <hi>John</hi> 8.29.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did not pay our debt by halves, but diſcharged it at once; in an intire ſum. The Damned are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Suffering, and yet never ſatisfie God: But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> offered one Sacrifice, the vertue of which laſts for ever; and, by this one Sacrifice he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected us for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12.14. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath, by this one Sacrifice, put an end to all Offerings for Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.18. Bloody Sacraments do ceaſe in the Church, and Bloody Sacrifices are much aboliſhed now out of the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by his Sacrifice, hath taken down the Vail, and opened a way to the Heavenly Sanctuary. This ſhewed that the Sacrifices of the Law were weak and defective; that though they were ſtill offered, yet the Vail ſtill ſtood, and the way into the Holieſt of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41823:148"/>all was not yet made manifeſt; thoſe Sacrifices could not give acceſs to God, and entrance into Heaven: But this diſcovered the excellency and efficacy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sacrifice, that when he Died, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.50, 51. <hi>The Vail of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom;</hi> To intimate, that now a way to Heaven was made by the renting the Vail of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Fleſh, and by ſeparating of his Soul from his Body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by travelling to Heaven, hath made a way; by entring into it, he hath made a door; by landing on the Shores of a Bleſſed Eternity, he hath made a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; this is a way ſtill new, a living way: This way is never ſtale, dead, or out of date; the High-Prieſt of old did kill a Sacrifice, and with the Blood of it he entred into the Typical Holy of Holies, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.11.14. But the virtue of that Sacrifice was exhauſted, and the way made by it was dead, ſo that he could not enter again a Second year, without killing of a new Sacrifice: But <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sacrifice is of ſuch virtue, that it makes a way always new, a living, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way into the Heavenly Sanctuary; that Believers in all ages may make uſe of.</p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:41823:148"/>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath carried his Blood into Heaven, and Sprinkled the Throne of God with it. The Mercy-Seat was ſprinkled with the Blood of the Sacrifice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.14. and this did figure, and teach, that the Throne of God muſt be ſprinkled with the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and how admirable a change doth it make? by turning a terrible Tribunal of Juſtice into a ſweet and amiable Throne of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt. Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace, Dan.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheeles as burning fire.</hi> God's Throne hath wheels to purſue Guilty Creatures, a fiery ſtream iſſued, and came forth from before him. This is a dreadful deſcription of God's Throne, as a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Juſtice: But now as it is ſprinkl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we have a moſt ſweet diſcovery of it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.1. <hi>There is a pure River of Water of Life, clear as Chryſtal, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and the Lamb, and there is a Rain-bow round about the Throne,</hi> Revel. 4.3. ſignifying the flood of God's Wrath is abated; and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is near the Throne to prevent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Sentence iſſuing out of it, and a ſtorm of Vengance falling from it.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>'s Blood is ſtill ſpeaking in Heaven and never ſilent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. And this ſpeaking Blood drowns the voice of the accuſer, and the cry of our Iniquities. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s repreſenting, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sacrifice in Heaven, is his burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Incenſe before the throne, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. to take away the ſtink of our Sins from the Noſtrils of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his death, hath dedicated, conſecrated, and confirmed a new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 16. The threatnings were in force before for our deſtruction, but the promiſes could not be in force for our Salvation, but by the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> God might have confirmed his threatnings by our death, but he hath confirmed his promiſes by the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> How different is the Language of the Law, and of the Goſpel? The Law ſaith, where there is an Offence, there muſt be of Neceſſity the death of the Offender: But the Goſpel ſpeakes thus; where there is a Teſtament there muſt of Neceſſity be the death of the Teſtator. Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeemed to die as a Malefactor in the eye of the World, yet he died as a Teſtator in the eye of God, and Believers: Though he was emptied and impoveriſhed, ſtript of all;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41823:149"/>of his Liberty, Garments, good Name, and Life, by his Enemies; yet even then he did Bequeath all good things, and died as a Teſtator to enrich others. O! that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould as it were put himſelf out of Poſſeſſion of all, to put us into Poſſeſſion of all good things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11.

Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> the great Sacrifice was cut in twain, his Soul and Body were Separated from each other, and by our paſſing through the parts of his Sacrifice by Faith we paſs (as the Hebrew phraſe is) into Covenant with God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.12.

It is ſtyled a <hi>New Covenant, Heb.</hi> 8.8. that which will never be Antiquated, or Abrogated. God hath now put his Covenant into the beſt, and moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent form.

                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by his Righteouſneſs, hath Merited the application of his Blood, and the beſtowing of all good things on us; this ſeems the faireſt ſence of thoſe words, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 17.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:41823:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>three expreſſions do note a continued act of God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſtill taking away ſin, cleanſing from it, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill Juſtifying Believers from their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were the Church of God, had an Atoning Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice day and dight Burning on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.8. which did not only ſignifie their continual need of Pardon, that ſin might not fix and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on them; but did alſo import the perpetual influence and efficacy of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for the keeping of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in a Juſtified State, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God. If by reaſon of wrong ſteps taken, God ceaſeth to Juſtifie, and the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſpeak on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of offending Believers, they muſt certainly be Condemned: If the guilt of one ſin redounds on the perſon, and ſticks on the Soul, a ſtate of Juſtification is deſtroyed: For how can a Man be Juſtified, and Condemned at the ſame time? if every new ſin redounds on the Perſon, and ſhuts it up under Guilt, Then how can there be any ſuch thing as a ſtate of Juſtification continuing one hour? But it is ſaid, ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities are pardoned without explicit or particular acts of Repentance, but it
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:41823:154"/>is not ſo with greater ſins. But ſhould not perſons do well to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath two ways to pardon? whether a General Repentance will ſerve to remove ſome Sins, but a more particular Repentance is requiſite, that God may pardon more heinous and grievous ſins: if theſe affect the perſon, and lay him under Condemnation till deeper Repentance, and more explicit acts of Faith be put forth, What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a ſtate of Juſtification? Was <hi>David</hi> under Condemnation, and the Curſe, while he lay long in a ſtupid ſtate? Surely he was a Juſtified Man, or elſe he was out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and fallen under the Curſe. It is ſaid that God hath given Believers everlaſting life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. and, <hi>that he who believeth hath everlaſting life, John</hi> 5.24. Is the Sentence of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. revoked by new acts of ſin? Is this gift of life retracted? Is the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> wiped away from the Conſcience by new Tranſgreſſions: We read that the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> purgeth away ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. but never that ſin purgeth away the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and wipes it off from the Conſcience. Let not any here mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me, I am no Patron of Sin, I do
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41823:155"/>not plead for careleſs and looſe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if any indulge the Fleſh, they ſhall feel to their ſmart and coſt, that God hath Fatherly Anger, Juſtice, and Severity, and the fruits of it are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: God hides his Face, ſuſpends the comfortable and quickning Influences of his Spirit, ſo that the heart is hardened, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. the Church thus complains, <hi>Why haſt thou hardened our hearts from thy Fear? Jeſus Chriſt</hi> withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and leaves the Soul in a dark, doubting, and diſconſolate ſtate, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.45.6. There are alſo ſharp Temporal Afflictions laid on believers, as that the Sword ſhould not depart from <hi>David</hi>'s Houſe, and that his <hi>Concubines</hi> ſhould be defiled by <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10, 11. yea, there may be much Trouble, and Terror of Conſcience, becauſe Unbelief is ſtrengthened by this new Guilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and the Spirit of God is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and doth not powerfully apply, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, and ſeal Pardon, till explicit acts of Faith and Repentance be put forth. Yet I muſt aſſert this with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That Believers do not again, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, or more, receive the <hi>Spirit of bondage to fear,</hi> Rom. 8.15. The Spirit in the Word doth not teſtifie to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41823:155"/>that he is a Condemned Man, in a ſtate of Hoſtility with God, and that God is his Enemy, as it teſtifies to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Men. Beſides, this is much to be conſidred, that a Believer doth not Sin according to the New Man, but according to the remainders of the Old Man: It is not the new Graft that bears corrupt fruit, but the old Stock, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Now it is no more I that do it, but Sin that dwelleth in me.</hi> The New Man hates Sin, conſents to, and delights in the Law of God as good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 16.19.22.25. <hi>I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God. He that is born of God committeth not Sin:</hi> He cannot Sin, becauſe born of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. How then can guilt redound on the whole perſon, when the New Man, that is the predominant party, doth not Sin? If it be ſaid, that Sin committed redounds on the perſon according to the Old Man, this will amount to no more than Fatherly anger, and Temporary Chaſtiſements that fall on the Old Man, that muſt decay, be pulled down to the duſt, and periſh; but they ſhall not hinder the Salvation of the perſon, according to the New Man. It is true, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth direct us dayly to pray for Pardon
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41823:156"/>of Sins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12. And <hi>David</hi> did earneſtly, and frequently ſollicit for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1.7.9. But theſe Scriptures may be thus underſtood, that Believers (for it is of them only that I ſpeak) do deprecate the Fruits, and effects of Gods Fatherly anger, both in Temporal, and Spiritual Judgments. They petition for the turning away of God's Fatherly diſpleaſure, the removing of outward Afflictions, and Spiritual Puniſhments, the return of the ſweet ſenſe of Gods Favour, the lifting up of the light of his Countenance on them; the ſhedding abroad of his Love in them. The removing of Temporal, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Judgements, is both a proper, and excellent Pardon. If any be otherwiſe minded, let them Anſwer a little Piece of Mr. <hi>Gilbert</hi>'s written on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>Juſtified perſons have a ſure, and ſtrong ſtanding in the Grace, and Favour of God, <hi>Rom</hi> 5.2. By Faith we have an entrance into this Grace, in which we ſtand and rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God. Juſtified perſons are Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firmly in the favour of God: Though <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> were caſt out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10, 12, 13.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:41823:156"/>yet <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Child of the promiſe, was ſtill retained. God loves Believers with the ſame love, that he loves <hi>Chriſt</hi> with, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>laſt.</hi> And God's love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not mutable, and changeable, but fixed, and certain. Juſtified perſons may therefore challeng all accuſers, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect; It is God that Juſtifieth?</hi> Is there any higher Judge? Is there any other Superiour Tribunal, to which the perſon may be cited, and his cauſe drawn? It is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that Died, and Roſe again: He was arreſted, and is releaſed, and diſcharged. He was Baptized in a deep Sea of Sorrows, and Sufferings, yet was not drowned, but Swam out to the Shores of a Bleſſed Eternity: Yea, he is aſcended into the Heavenly. Sanctuary, to plead his blood, and Repreſent his Righteouſneſs; And will not this ſtop the mouths of all gain-ſayers, and Silence all accuſers? We may now draw near to God the Judge of all, as being aſſured, he will not only Juſtifie us, but alſo plead our cauſe againſt thoſe that wrong us. <hi>Chriſt</hi> now being aſcended, he lives to execute his own Teſtament, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his own Legacies, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. To give Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sins.

There was a Crown of pure Gold about the Altar of incenſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.3. to intimate, that our High-Prieſt doth interceed effectually, and with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will, that thoſe thou haſt given me, may be with me, that they may ſee my Glory.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> propoſeth a Farther Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> and he thus anſwereth it himſelf: <hi>I am perſwaded that neither Life, nor Death, things preſent, or things to come, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> The Love of God is fixed, the Heart of God is centred on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſhall never depart, or remove from him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the ſtrong and everlaſting bond where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Gods Love is ſecured, and aſſured to us. What greater ſecurity can God give us than his Oath to perſwade us of the Immutability of his counſel: God hath twice ſworn, that the Heires of

God ſaith thus to the Church, I have ſworn that I will not be Wroth with thee; that is, to deſtroy thee, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee, ſo as to diſinherit thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9. And as God hath Sworn to ſecure us from the greateſt Evils, ſo he Swears again to aſſure us of the greateſt good. <hi>By my ſelf have I Sworn</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abraham) that in Bleſſing I will Bleſs thee, Heb.</hi> 6.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> is made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, do alſo receive the Holy Spirit.

Some call the gift of the Spirit Executive Juſtification; they mean that God executes the Sentence of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by beſtowing the Spirit, to break off our Chaines, burn up our Droſs, purge away our Filth, and <hi>make us free from the Law of Sin, and Death, Rom.</hi> 8.2. Though the Law of Sin be a ſtrong, and powerful Law to inſlave us; yet the Law of the Spirit of Life is more mighty to ſet us free; as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by his Blood, redeems us to be the Temple of God, ſo by his Spirit he comes into his Temple, takes Poſſeſſion of it, and fills it with his
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41823:158"/>Glory. As we live by the Sentence of Juſtification, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> lives in us by the Spirit of Sanctification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. The Spirit is given as a Tree of Life, and all Graces are the Fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is given as the well of all Living Waters, and Spritual ſtreames, <hi>John</hi> 4.14. <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38, 39.

God is a Refining Fire, that he may not be a conſuming fire, as a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Blood, to allay a Feaver, and cure a Diſeaſe. 3. God deſigns, by Afflictions, to make us partakers of his Holineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10, 11. that we might learn more to live to him, and be brought more to live on him, that we might leſs ſolace our ſelves in the Creature, and more delight in himſelf: that we might be more conformed to him, and be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitted to converſe with him. Though Afflictions are Puniſhments to the Old Man, to pull it down; yet they are Mercies to the New Man, to build it up. A poor Man would quietly ſuffer his Lord to pull down an old decaying ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cottage, if he did believe that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to raiſe, and build up a ſtrong
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41823:162"/>and better Houſe: all Afflictions tend but to waſt, and extinguiſh the life of the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the Body, to make room for, and to let in the glorious life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into it at the Reſurrection. 4. This is a weighty and powerful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to leſſen, and lighten the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and bitterneſs of our Afflictions; that Juſtification gives a Fatal and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Blow at the root of them. The time is coming, when the Inhabitants of <hi>Zion</hi> ſhall not any more ſay, that they are ſick, for their Iniquities ſhall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. <hi>laſt.</hi> God ſhall wipe away all tears from the eyes of Saints: there ſhall be no more pain, ſorrow, or crying, no more Death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.4. No more Curſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.3. The days of Saints mourning ſhall be at an end, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.20. All Afflictions are but ſhort and momentary, and therefore but light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Death is an Advantage to Juſtified Perſons. Death is theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>To die is gain,</hi> Phil. 1.21. In Death the Wicked Fear the greateſt evil, but the Righteous hope for the greateſt good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32. When the Body falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bondage of Corruption, the Souls of Believers are perfectly freed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41823:162"/>from the Bondage of Sin. Though it be a Mournful Seed-time to our Fleſh, <hi>it is ſown in corruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.42. yet it is a Joyful Harveſt to the Spirit, for it reaps Everlaſting Life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8. Death, that is in it ſelf, the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, hath Colour put into its pale Cheeks; and it is changed into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing. Death in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the purchaſe of all our happineſs; and Death, to Believers, is the way to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it: by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death they are Heirs in Reverſion; by their own Death they are Heirs in Poſſeſſion: that which ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoveriſhes others, greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches them: that which kills the Body, perfectly cures the Soul. When our baſer part ſhall return to the Duſt, feed Worms, dwell in the darkneſs of the Grave; our better part ſhall be called up to the Marriage Feaſt, to ſee the Face of God, and dwell in glorious Light, and Reign in a Bleſſed Life. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made Death Mortal, and threatens to be a Plague, a Deadly diſeaſe to it, and to be Deſtruction to the Grave, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13, 14.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Conſider the woful condition of thoſe, that are not Intereſted in this Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is wiſhed as the worſt Curſe, and denounced as the greateſt Evil, for Men not to come into the Righteouſneſs of God; <hi>Add Iniquity to their Iniquity, and let them not come into thy Righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 69.27. It was the Sin of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:41823:164"/>that they Submitted not to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. and this is inflicted as a ſuitable puniſhment; <hi>Let them not come into thy Righteouſneſs.</hi> Their own choice is turned into a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imprecation; for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such will add Iniquity to Iniquity: as it is expreſſed in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.27. They will do nothing elſe but multiply provocations, increaſe guilt, heighten and inflame Wrath; run further from God, and harden themſelves more againſt God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as Reject <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, are under the Law as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. This is their choice, this is their deſire, they would be under the Law; and this is a bad ſtate; for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Law gives no ſtrength, or Life, <hi>John</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Law came by Moſes; but Grace and Truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is only an urging Letter, an exacting Command; all the Grace to obey comes by, and from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> The Law doth not quicken our dead Soules, it is only a ſound of words; it gives us no power. Therefore when the <hi>Iſraelites heard it they could not bear it, but deſired that the word ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more,</hi> Heb. 12.19.20. Hereby they
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41823:165"/>confeſſed their guilt, impotency, inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and utter deſpair of keeping the Law, as it ought to be obeyed. <hi>Hagar</hi> was a young Woman, and bare <hi>Iſmael</hi> by Natural ſtrength. So the Law ſuppoſes, that we ſhould have kept the ſtrength, that God beſtowed at our firſt Creation, and by it render perfect obedience to its Commands: But the new Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores Life, and gives ſtrength. So <hi>Sarah,</hi> though ſhe was barren, and now paſt age, yet by Faith received ſtrength to conceive Seed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. But the Law gives no ſtrength, furniſhes us with no new ſtock to trade again with: It doth not change the Table of the Heart, it is ſtill a Stony, hard Rebellious Heart. The Law is weak as to its commands, becauſe our Luſts are ſo ſtrong, and its Promiſes are weak and ineffectual; becauſe our Fleſh is ſo powerful, and predominant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Moſes</hi> did only hew, ſmooth, and plain the Tables, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.1. but he did not make them ſoft, they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Stone: So, however the Law may ſmooth, and poliſh Men's Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, yet their wills are ſtill perverſe, and obſtinate againſt its Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.4. I knew thou waſt obſtinate, and haſt an Iron ſinew. <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:41823:165"/>did Conquer the utmoſt Borders, and the out-skirts of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the Country of <hi>Sihon,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Baſhan;</hi> but did not pierce into the Heart of the Country, and ſubdue it: This was leſt to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> a Type of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The utmoſt the Law doth, is but to reſtrain Sin in the Converſations, and to Reform the Life; when Men ſerve in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Letter; but Sin ſtill keeps its Throne in the Heart: Proud Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, or raging Deſpair is uſually found in Legaliſts. Though the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> heard the Law given by God himſelf, ſaw his dreadful, terrible Majeſty, and Glory, in the giving of it, yet they preſently fell to Idolatry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.1.4, 5, 6. This Idolatry ſo ſoon Commited, did ſhew, that the Law gave no power to obey and fullfil its own Commands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Law abates nothing, remits nothing of its demands on the account of our weakneſs: It requires as much ſervice of Sick and weak Man, as if he were ſound, and ſtrong: It calls for as full payment of the poor Bankrupt Creature as if it were Rich: The Law makes no compoſition with, or allowance to decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inſolent debters; yea, though it doth Curſe us for our Diſobedience to,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41823:166"/>and Enmity againſt God, yet, at the ſame time it Requires us to Love God with all our Heart, Mind, Soul and Strength, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Law, by woful experience, is found to ſtir up Sin, when it's moſt pure and Spiritual Commands are urged upon the Conſcience: The motions of Sin are ſaid to be by the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. When the ſtrict Commands of the Law are preſſed on the Conſcience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dweling Sin rouſes up it ſelf; growes more Violent, and Outragious. A Bridge, ſet over, and giving ſome check to a ſtream, cauſes its ſmooth calm waters to rage, and make a noiſe; ſo Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more impetuous by that oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it meets withal from the Law of God. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>That Sin taking occaſion by the Law deceived him, and ſo ſlew him,</hi> Rom. 7.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>When the Commandments came, Sin revived;</hi> raiſed up it ſelf more to reſiſt, and contradict the Law of God. This was very ſtrange, and ſurprizing to <hi>Paul,</hi> he was decived in this, he thought the Law would have repreſſed, beaten down, and mortified Sin; but it rather fortified it. As a Man that doth not know the Nature of Burning Lime,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:41823:166"/>thinks, by pouring a little water on it, to quench it; but when he ſeeth that this water makes it to burn more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently and fiercely; How would he, as amazed, cry out, How am I deceived, that the water ſhould increaſe the Fire, that I thought would extinguiſh it? So, the Law doth not weaken Sin, but rather ſtrengthen it, and render it more violent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Law puniſhes every Sin with Death. Every Luſt is mortal, every wrong ſtep is fatal, and corrupt Fruit is pernitious, and deſtructive. Though <hi>Iſmael</hi> might be guilty of many other offences, yet for a weighty reaſon <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions but one, and that was his mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and for this he was caſt out, and caſt off, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> was <hi>Hagar</hi>'s Child, and, ſo, a Type of them that cleave to the Covenant of Works. The Law Curſes for every act of Diſobedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>laſt.</hi> One offence according to the Covenant of Works, is enough to undo, and Ruin a Man to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is no acceſs to God by the Covenant of Works. When the Law was given, Bounds were ſet about Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to keep off the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:41823:167"/>they were charged not to break through. Death was denounced as the Puniſhment of thoſe that touched the Mountain, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.12.13.21. The people therefore removed, and ſtood a-far off, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18. None of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſts, or Worſhiping <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might enter into the Tabernacle till Atonement was made for their Sins by <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Prieſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16, 17. But after that Sacrifices were Slain, Offered, and their Blood Sprinkled on the Altar and the People; then <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Aaron,</hi> and Seventy of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> aſcended Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſaw the Glory of the God of <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 24.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Theſe Sacrifices were but Types of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death: he died, the Juſt for the Unjuſt, to bring us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. elſe we are ſhut out of the Glorious Preſence of God, and cut off from all Gracious and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Communion with him. God is not acceſſible: by the Covenant of Works guilty Creatures are kept off from him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The Law genders to Bondage,</hi> Galat. 4.22. a Spirit of Bondage to Fear at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. as <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> had a ſlaviſh Fear of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a Maſter, rather than a Conjugal Love
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:41823:167"/>to him as a Husband, or a Filial Love to him as a Father. Thoſe under the Covenant of Works are ſtill doubting of God's Favour, queſtioning his Love, dreading of his Wrath: They do not know whither Death will carry them, and where Judgment will fix them; and therefore, through the Fear of Death, <hi>they are all their Life-time ſubject to Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> Heb. 2.15. the fear of the evil that is future doth embitter to them all preſent Good. The Law was given in ſuch a Manner, that it was deſigned to ſtrike Fear and Terror into Sinners. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were then alone with God in the Wilderneſs, ſeparated from all other Nations. This might inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that God and the Sinner ſhall be alone together, and all pleaſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and delightful Enjoyments ſhall be ſhut out. The Thunder did roar in their Ears, and the Lightning did flaſh and flame in their Eyes, and the Earth did tremble under their Feet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.16, 18. Whither ſhall a Guilty Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner betake himſelf, when the Heavens do threaten Vengeance over his head, and the Earth ſeems ſinking under his feet. <hi>The Mountain did burn with fire, Exod.</hi> 19.16, 18. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.23. this
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41823:168"/>did repreſent the fiery Throne of God, and his burning Wrath, wherewith, as a Judge, he is Armed, to puniſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe that truſt in their Works, and will have to do with God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Covenant of Works. But though the Mountain did burn, yet it was not conſumed. So, guilty Creatures ſhall burn in the fire of God's Wrath, yet never be conſumed, or ceaſe to be. There was <hi>Blackneſs, Darkneſs and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,</hi> Heb. 12.18. Theſe pointed at the perplexed ſtate of a Sinner, the horrour and conſternation of the Soul, when God, the Judge, doth ſhew his Juſtice and Wrath for the Violation of the Condition of the Covenant of Works. O what black darkneſs will cover Sinners! O what a Terrible Storm and Tempeſt will one day be raiſed in, and fall upon their Souls. The ſound of the Trumpet, <hi>that was exceeding loud,</hi> Exod. 19.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.19. did ſignifie, that Sinners muſt be cited to, and preſented before the Tribunal of God; neither can any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, or avoid appearing before God's Juſtice-Seat: Yet the Apoſtle calls this Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> a Mountain, that was in it ſelf Tangible, or might be touched, that ſo it was an Earthly and Material
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:41823:168"/>Mountain, becauſe the Diſpenſation of the Law, and Covenant of Works, is but a low Diſpenſation: A Natural Man may Touch, and Reach this; that God will inflict evil on thoſe that rebel and do evil. When as the Covenant of Grace is a Spiritual, and Inviſible Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, far above the reach and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, above the ſight and ken of a Natural Man. And what did all this Terror, in giving the Law, tend to, but to raiſe a Spirit of Bondage in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and, by Fear, to drive and force ſinners to ſome External Obedience to the Letter of the Law, which yet they perform with Regret and Reluctancy, and not with Love and delight.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is no enjoyment of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Inheritance by the Law; the Bond-woman and her Son were to be caſt out, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.20, 21. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.8.10. <hi>Iſmael</hi> was not admitted, or allowed to be an Heir with <hi>Iſaac.</hi> He did not Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Rich Eſtate. <hi>Moſes</hi> could not bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into, or give them poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> this, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> were turned out with a ſmall pittance: they had but a few Loaves, and a Bottle of Water. It may
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41823:169"/>ſeem ſtrange, that Rich <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould provide no better for his Wife and Child; but there was a Myſtery in it: it ſerved to inſtruct us, that thoſe that are of the works of the Law, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Heirs of Heaven: cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs any Spiritual Riches, or an Eternal portion in Glory; but are put off with Temporary, Momentary Comforts and Enjoyments. What are the beſt things that this World affords? What are Earthly Riches, Honours or Pleaſures, compared with an Eternal Happineſs? they are but as a few Loaves of Bread, and a Bottle of Water. When <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> were turned out, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a Wilderneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.14. O what a difference was there between the plenty and abundance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the wants of a Barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? The World it ſelf is but a Wilderneſs, compared with the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.7. A Legal ſtate under the Covenant of Works, What is it but a wretched Barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? In our fleſh dwells no good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. and therefore the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes us no good. And may not this ſtate be fitly compared to a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which we are deſtitute of all good.</p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:41823:169"/>
                  <p n="8">8. Though the Law be Ancient, yet it is not Abrogated, but ſtill ſtands in full Force againſt thoſe that are out of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Though <hi>Moſes</hi> was old, yet his Eye-ſight did not decay, neither did his Natural Force and Vigour abate, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.9. This ſeems to point at the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Strength and ſtanding Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law. Mens Laws grow abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete, and out of date: by age they are ſilently Abrogated and Repealed: but it is not ſo with God's Law. As God required <hi>Moſes</hi>'s his Life when he was in full ſtrength; and then Buried him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.5, 6. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> puts an end to the Law, as a Covenant of Works, and Buries its Curſe, when it was in its full ſtrength. <hi>As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.10. though they are not groſly wicked, but ſeemingly obedient to the Letter of it, yet they cannot decline, or avoid the Curſe, it will take hold of them, and be executed on them.</p>
                  <p>It is dreadful to be under the Law, tho' ſome inconſiderately deſire to be under it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. Dr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> in his Book of the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary, cap.</hi> 2. tells us of a proud <hi>Jew</hi> that ſaid, He would ſtand upon his own Legs:
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41823:170"/>he would not be beholding to any to Fulfil the Law for him, or to ſatisfie for his ſins, but he would do it for himſelf, and go to Heaven on his own Feet. How many are there of the ſame mind with this Inſolent and Ignorant Rabbi? But thoſe that ſtick to the Covenant of Works do put on themſelves a Yoke, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. that they are never able to bear: they bind on themſelves a Weighty Burden, that will make their Backs to bow down alway, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.10. and cauſe their Loyns to ſhake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.23. Can you pay your Debt of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or endure when God ſhall inflict upon you that Debt of Puniſhment that he owes you? Can you ſtand, when he doth mark your Iniquities? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. Can your hands be ſtrong? Can your hearts endure in the day that God ſhall have to do with you? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14. and contend with you? <hi>Job</hi> 9.3. Tho' you are now ſecure, Will not your Peace then end in War? Your Calm iſſue in a Storm? your preſent ſilence terminate in the Loud Thunder of Wrath and Vengeance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you are not Intereſted in this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſo not Pardoned; God can take no Good out of his Treaſury
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41823:170"/>to give you in Mercy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. Theſe two things are joyned together to take away Iniquity, and make Good that which our Tranſlators have rendred, <hi>Receive us graciouſly,</hi> it is in the Original <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap>, <hi>and take Good;</hi> that is, take it out of thy Treaſury to beſtow it on us. Good cannot be taken, and given to us, till Iniquity be taken from us. Guilt is that mighty Damm, that ſtops the Current of God's Goodneſs: It is a Lock on God's Treaſury it is a Seal on the Fountain of Life: it ſeparates between God and us, and hinders Good things from us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. Do any find a Drought of Mercy, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min of Bleſſings, let them thank their Iniquities for it? theſe are the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, the grand obſtruction of Good things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God accepts no Service, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Good Will from Perſons Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified. God's eye muſt firſt be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Perſon, as accepting him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Ear is opened to his Prayer, as regarding and approving it: It may ſeem a ſtrange expreſſion, that God's eye ſhould be open to a Supplication, yet this phraſe is uſed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.52. It inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that God's eye muſt firſt be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41823:171"/>on the Perſon, before his ear is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enclined to hear his Prayer. God firſt had reſpect to <hi>Abel,</hi> and then to his Offering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. but God had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Cain,</hi> or to his Offering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.5. it is very probable at leaſt, that God's rejecting <hi>Cain,</hi> and his Offering, was plainly to be diſcerned by ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward viſible Sign, or Token. When God, of old, accepted a Sacrifice, he did ſend Fire from Heaven to conſume it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. <hi>laſt.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.38. but it ſeems God did ſend no Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to conſume <hi>Cain</hi>'s Offering, and ſo to Teſtifie that he was well-pleaſed with it, and did accept of it. <hi>Cain</hi> might take it away again, and imploy it to a common uſe, God did not value or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it. The main Ingredient that is requiſite to ſeaſon acts of Worſhip, and to render them ſavoury to God, was wanting. Faith, in the Promiſed Seed, was neceſſary to endear the Perſon, and commend the Offering to God; but, where this is not found, God ſaith to Worſhippers, <hi>I have no pleaſure in you, neither will I accept an Offering at your band,</hi> Mal. 1.10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All their Bleſſings are Curſed to them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Their proſperity doth
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:41823:171"/>deſtroy them,</hi> Prov. 1.32. Honour heightens their Pride; Riches Fetter and Chain their Minds and Hearts: The Cares of the World are as an Over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or Lading to a Ship, that hinders them from Sailing towards the Port of Heaven; and ſinks their Souls into Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Cares and Luſts are as Thorns that choak the good Seed of the Word, and hinder it from bringing any Fruit to perfection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. The Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the World do fuel their Luſts, increaſe their Senſuality, and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Carnalize their Minds and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Every Attribute of God is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them; God's Holineſs loathes them as unclean, God's Juſtice hates them as Rebels and Enemies, that preſs all the Creatures to take up Arms againſt their Maker; but they themſelves are Volunteers in this wicked Warfare. Infinite Wiſedom doth deviſe devices againſt them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.11. doth invent meanes to puniſh, and deſtroy them; for God is wiſe in Heart, and mighty in ſtrength, <hi>Joh</hi> 9.4. Infinite Power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes, what Infinite Wiſedom hath contrived. God lives to Eternity to pour out the Vials of his Wrath on them,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:41823:172"/>and to meaſure out the Revenges of his Juſtice to them. A Contending time will come, <hi>Job</hi> 9.3. God's angry Face will be unvailed, and his puniſhing Arm be made bare: his Fury will come up in his Face, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.18. and will be terribly Executed by his Hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.8. His eares will be ſtopt againſt their cries: His Bowels be ſhut, his Heart be hardened againſt their miſery. They ſhall never ſee the Light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.19. They ſhall never ſee Life, <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> They ſhall never taſt of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.24. Worms that die ſhall prey on their Bodies, the worm that never dies ſhall feed on their Souls.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider how bad it will be with thoſe in a dying hour, that have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs: If Men are not Judicially blinded, and hardened, they cannot but be ſomewhat concerned about their Future ſtate, when they walk on the Borders, and ſtand on the Brink of Eternity. How much are Men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, and terrified at the Thoughts of Death? Therefore they are very unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtep beyond Death in their thoughts, or to Travel into Eternity in their Meditations. They Fear to meet with a terrible Hoſt of Sins, an Ocean of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:41823:172"/>Wrath, a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone. They bode no good to themſelves at their departure out of this World. God the great Creditor Records their debts, and Conſcience, his Officer, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times charge them, and arreſt their Souls: They have no Spiritual Balſom then to heal their wounds; No arm to lean on, to ſupport their Souls: None to roll away the Burden of their Guilt, to pacify, or quiet their accuſing and condemning Conſcience: To Bail them when they are arreſted for a debt of Ten thouſand Talents; they cannot look inward, but they ſee an Evil Treaſure, and a Conſcience loaded with Dead Works: They cannot look upward, but they ſee God's frowning Face, and Fiery Throne: They cannot look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but they ſee a deep pit, a dark Priſon, and Revenging Juſtice armed for their deſtruction. The Covenant of Works is a continual Root of doubts and feares; Legaliſts are ſtill queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and asking, Who ſhall deſcend into the Deep, to ſatisfy them? That the Gates of Hell are ſhut, that they ſhall not enter by, and paſs through them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Regions of Darkneſs, and Miſery: Or, they inquire, Who ſhall aſcend up
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:41823:173"/>to Heaven, to aſſure them that the Doer of Heaven is open, to let them into Glory? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7. They have ſtill perplexed minds, and anxious thoughts, they cannot ſee themſelves ſecured from a Miſerable, or aſſured of a Bleſſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: They fear they ſhall make a ruining, and undoing change; be total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Shipwrackt, and caſt away, Body and Soul for ever. They cannot totally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the thoughts of Eternity, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably entertain them: They can neither ſtupify nor pacifie Conſcience. How often are Sinners terribly awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and alarm'd when Death looks them in the Face? O! what a bitter cry of Deſtruction do they then lift up, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15.5. <hi>All their Sins</hi> (as the adverſaries of <hi>Zion</hi> once did) <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.31. <hi>do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them between the Straits,</hi> when they walk through the narrow Valley of the ſhadow of death; as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf was in an Agony near his end, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. When he ſaw what an Hoſt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Enemies he muſt Fight through, what an Ocean of Wrath he muſt Swim through, this put him into a Bloody ſweat: When he beheld the Frowning Face of God, the Fiery Throne, and the Flaming Sword of Juſtice, this drew
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:41823:173"/>ſtrong Cryes and Teares from <hi>Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 5.7. So if Sinners be not ſtupified, if they ſee themſelves going to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal execution, that they will be ever Suffering, and never die: That there will ſtill be Food for an Everlaſting Worm, and Fuel for an Eternal Fire; This will fill them with Conſternation and Horrour. Condemned Tranſgreſſors muſt bear their Iniquities, yet cannot ſtand, or bear up under this load: They cannot ſtay, yet dare not to depart; they cannot hide, yet are not fit to appear; they muſt ſtand before the Judgement Seat of <hi>Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 14.10. yet cannot ſtand in the Judgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5. They muſt appear before that Tribunal, <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. where yet they cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, or Comfortably appear, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. They dread the next ſtep they ſhall take, when out of the Body: where their Lot will fall, and what their Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be to Eternity. Beleivers indeed do confidently commit, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Soules into the Hands of their Redeemer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. But wicked Men full ſorely againſt their wills muſt fall into the Hands of an angry Creditor, and of an inexorable Judge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. They muſt anſwer for their own Sins;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41823:174"/>there is no other to pay their Debts, Satisfie for their Offences, Plead for their Reconciliation: All their Iniquities will overtake them in another World, and meet them at the Tribunal of God: None of them are blotted out, or paſſed over. God hath Sworn by himſelf he will never forget any of them, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.7. God will open the Treaſury of his Wrath, and ſhut up the Bowels of his Mercy; he will remember Iniquity, and therefore forget to be Gracious: God will enter into Judgement with Sinners, and ſtand up to plead againſt them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.13, 14. Delinquents muſt appear, Criminals muſt be brought unto Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. and all their thoughts, words and actions muſt appear, and be brought into Judgement, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. <hi>laſt.</hi> God will paſs a Juſt Condemning Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and terribly Execute it on them. As the Sun was Eclypſed, and darkneſs covered the Earth, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died; ſo the Gracious Countenance of God will be Eternally Eclypſed towards Sinners. <hi>Chriſt</hi> met with Affronts, Indignities, Blowes before the Tribunal of Men; And what muſt Sinners look for at the Tribunal of God? <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was denied any refreſhment when he thirſted; So
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41823:174"/>Sinners ſhall not obtain a drop to cool their ſcorched tongues, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22, 23, 24, 25. As the Waters did perſue all, that were out of the Ark, till they were drowned; So, Sin ſhall hunt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, find out and overtake Sinners for their Eternal Deſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35.63. <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.23. All that is grateful, and ſweet in the being of Sinners ſhall be conſumed; yet they themſelves ſhall ſtill exiſt to ſuffer more Puniſhment and Torment. God's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with Sinners will never be at an end: His Sword will never be ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The dreadful ſtorm of Vengeance will never ceaſe. God's Eternity will be dreadful, for he ever lives to puniſh: and the Soul's own Immortality will be terrible to it; For it ſhall ever exiſt to be puniſhed: So that Sinners would rather ſleep in the duſt for ever, than to have a Reſurection to Condemnation, <hi>John</hi> 5.28. and had rather be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than ſuffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire. If departing Souls did ſee whither they were going, and know what they muſt ſuffer, Would not their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſound with theſe dreadful words? We muſt dwell with Everlaſting Fire! we muſt inhabit with Eternal Burnings!</p>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:41823:176"/>how fooliſh is this, to put their own Death in the room and place of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death. Yet this doth not allay their Fears; they further own, that all, or many of them, muſt ſuffer pains in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, for Eleven or Twelve Moneths; and that they need the help of their Living Friends to Pray them out of this place and pains. The <hi>Bannians,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> are Baptized in the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> for the cleanſing away of their Sins (as Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> relates in his Hiſtory) ſome do bring the Dead Bodies of their Friends ten days Journey, or more, to waſh them in the River <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> that they may be purified from guilt; others do ſtand in painful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, with one Leg up; others do Vow they will never eat any thing but what they find on the High-way.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41823:178"/>we are (as it were) put in Priſon, and ſhut up, under Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Law; and all this is to cauſe us to find our need of, and to make us Sigh, and ſeek for a Redeemer to open our Priſon-door, and give Liberty to our Souls, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. The Law, if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, drives us from it ſelf. <hi>I, through the Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>am dead to the Law,</hi> Gal. 2.19. As the Glorious Light that did ſhine in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Face did Terriſie the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and drive them from him, diſcourage, or deter them from coming near to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.30, 32, 33. So, that Glorious Purity and Holineſs, that Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Severe Juſtice, that ſhines in the Face of the Law, ſhould drive us from Reſting in, or truſting on the Law for Righteouſneſs, and deſpair of ever being pronounced Righteous by it. Shall the Law, that was intended but for a School-Maſter, to direct us unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (Gal. 3.24.) be made a Father, to give us an Inheritance of Righteouſneſs? But how many have groſly erred, and grievouſly miſtaken about this? they have Enervated, and Diſpirited the Law of God: they have pared off a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:41823:179"/>great deal of its Purity, cut off much of its Spirituality, and made it to look like the Civil Law of Man, as if it were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to check words and reſtrain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts, but was not preſcribed to the heart: but the Law is like the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: as he ſeeth the Motions of the Mind and Will; ſo, his Law forbids all evil Thoughts, and Vile Affections, and on this account it is called Spiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. But the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> did think the Law of God did not reach to Regulate, or Condemn thoſe Evils, that were the meer Creatures of the Heart. How elſe could the Elder Brother, ſignifying the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> ſay to God his Father, <hi>Lo theſe many years have I ſerved thee, neither at any time have I tranſgreſſed thy word,</hi> Luke 15.28. <hi>Paul,</hi> when a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> thought himſelf, as touching the Righteouſneſs of the Law, <hi>to be blameleſs,</hi> Phil. 3.6. Theſe account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to be ſuch Juſt Men, that they needed no Repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7. To theſe the Goſpel is Fooliſhneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Is it not folly to ſpeak of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, Healing, Liberty, to thoſe that never thought themſelves to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to God, to be Sick, Priſoners, or Captives? How doth the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:41823:179"/>day pervert, and corrupt the Law of God? they call the moſt Spiritual part of it, not a Command, but a Counſel: to Love God ſincerely, ſome of them will allow to be a Command; but, to Love him with all the Mind, Soul, Heart and Strength, this they aſſert to be but a Counſel, and not a Command. And without this Wicked Opinion, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Maintain their other Errors, that Men may be perfect in this Life, and truly fulfil the whole Law of God. Thus Men do at this day by their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Gloſſes, Falſe Diſtinctions, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Interpretations of the Law of God, Undermine its Purity, Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Perfection; and ſo clap a Vail on <hi>Moſes</hi> his Face, that the Law may not be Terrible to them, but that they may draw near to it, and truſt on it for their Juſtification. Thus Men go about to eſtabliſh their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by derogating, and detracting from the Extent and Obligation of the Law: they Lower the Law, that they may Heighten and Exalt their own Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Come to, and deſcend into your ſelves, that you may find out that evil Treaſure, that Root of Bitterneſs, that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:41823:180"/>Fountain of Iniquity, that is in your ſelves. <hi>Abraham,</hi> as touching the Fleſh, did not find a Righteouſneſs in himſelf to boaſt of, and Glory in; And can we find that in our ſelves, that <hi>Abraham</hi> could not find in himſelf? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2. If we cannot find Righteouſneſs in our ſelves, do we not need to be found in <hi>Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.9. To ſtay, and truſt on that Righteouſneſs which is of God by the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we muſt deſire God (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith) not only to turn away his Eyes from our Sins, but alſo from our Services; not only to forgive our wrong ſteps out of the way; but alſo our ſlow ſteps in it; when we are bought with ſo great a price, and encouraged to run with ſo Glorious a Prize ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. We may ſee enough in our ſelves to Condemn us. We are Children of Wrath, by nature, and Children of Diſobedience by practice. Every faculty is diſeaſed, and perverted, every Work of ours is corrupted and defiled. God threatens the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſpread the dung of their Solemn Feaſts on their faces, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.3. The Beaſts that were brought into the Courts of the Temple on the Feaſt-days, did dung in them. God ſeems to compare the faults and failings in the

                     <hi>Jews</hi> Spiritual Sacrifices to the dung of thoſe Beaſts that were Offered up in Sacrifice. Perhaps <hi>Paul</hi> may allude to this expreſſion, when he accounts his own Righteouſneſs and priviledges to be but Dung, there is ſome of the Dung of the Old Man that is vented in, and mixed with our beſt performances; that doth ſtain, defile, and, in part at leaſt, render them unſavoury before God. Sin dwells in us, is preſent with us: We can never ſhake it off, ſhut it out, or totally leave it behind us, when we draw near to God: We cannot put God in mind of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect duty, but he can put us in mind of Thouſands of defective Services per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us. If we dwell at home, and truſt in our ſelves, Revenging Juſtice will break in upon us, and deſtroy us: If we ſtay abroad, do not fly to, and Houſe our ſelves in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a ſtorm of Fire and Brimſtone will be Rained on us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. We needed <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death on Earth, and we want his Interceſſion in Heaven, that the Iniquity of our Holy things may not be charged on us for our Condemnation and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt beware of unbelief, as to God's threat'nings, and take heed of Carnal ſecurity. Sinners are too apt to

Some conceive that the Apoſtle alludes to thoſe that are bit wit an Aſp; if that Serpent doth prick them they doze ſlumber, and die away. The Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent did not only Poyſon us by his bite, but alſo ſtupifie us, that we might not be ſenſible of our danger. Some are ſo deep aſleep, that though they are prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it will not rouſe them up, even ſo, many are in ſuch a profound ſleep, that though God pricks them daily with his Threat'nings, yet they are not awakened to a ſerrious Conſideration,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:41823:181"/>and dread of approaching deſtruction: God threatens it as a ſore Judgement to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhould be dumb, and that he ſhould not be a Reprover to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.26. And how long was he dumb? it was till <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was taken, and ſmitten, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.21, 22. It was but the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Meſſenger came with theſe bad tidings, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s mouth was opened, and he was no more dumb: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was dumb till the Judgement denounced was executed on the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then it was too late to warn and Reprove them. And wilt thou provoke God to lay thee under ſuch a Spiritual Judgment? Shall Conſcience be dumb, and not Reprove thee, til Divine Vengeance fall on thee for thy deſtruction? Take heed that thou doſt not fortify, and intrench thy ſelf in Natural Religion, Morality, and Formal Duties, and ſo bear the Siege, and ſtorm of powerful Preaching. God complains of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by <hi>Zechary,</hi> that they made their Hearts as an Adamant Stone, leaſt they ſhould hear the Law. The word, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:41823:182"/>from being broken under the many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, and Reproofs of the Word. Beware, that ſuch a Heart be not found in thee: Do not make light of, or a mock at, Sin. Do not put the thoughts of thy Iniquity, and of God's Wrath far from thee. Sin lies at the door, if not ſooner, it will arreſt thy Soul when it goes out of the Body, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he that rolleth a Stone it ſhall return upon him,</hi> Prov. 26.27. So if you Preſumptuouſly roll away your Sins from you, God will Righteouſly return them upon you. God's Threat'nings are not an empty ſound: Sinners ſhall know, to their coſt, that God hath not ſaid in vain, <hi>That he would poure out his Fury on them,</hi> Ezek. 6.10. The day of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is in God's Heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.4. The Cup of Fury is in his Hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.8. Though there be a mixture of all fatal and deadly ingredients, yet it is without any mixture of Mercy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. The ſtorm of Vengeance hangs over the Heads of Sinners. Though it is ſaid, that now God's Judgments are far above out of the ſight of Sinners, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.5. yet they ſhall be ſo viſible, that their eyes ſhall ſee their Deſtruction, <hi>Job</hi> 21 20. thy breath is in thy Noſtrils, <hi>Iſa.</hi>

So Carnal Reaſon miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if it were nothing ſolid or ſubſtantial. The Blaſphemous Papiſts call Imputed Righteouſneſs, <hi>Putative Righteouſneſs</hi> as if it did only ſpring up in, and were born from the Fantaſies of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Proud Nature thinks the Righteouſneſs that is wrought, and brought forth by our ſelves, to be the only ſubſtantial and valuable Righteouſneſs; but the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-minded (as <hi>Paul</hi>) do account the

We muſt caſt out our Luſts, as <hi>Jonah,</hi> that we may not be drowned in Perdition: we muſt ſuffer in our fleſh, that is, in our corrupt Nature, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. that we may not ſuffer in our Souls and Bodies to Eternity. Tho' God will be Reconciled to Sinners, yet not to Sin: though <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to ſhew Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Offenders, yet his deſign is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Severity on the Devil's Work in us, and to deſtroy Iniquity, 1 <hi>John</hi> 38. yet it is not Repentance, but Faith, that receives God's Gift and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. yea, Repentance being <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Gift, Doth not Faith receive it? Some ſay, there
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:41823:187"/>cannot be a Fiducial act of Faith before Repentance. But muſt we not truſt, on God, through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for a new heart of fleſh to be given to us? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. And is not this a Fiducial Act of Faith? Can we truſt on <hi>Chriſt</hi> for any Spiritual Grace or Good, till we truſt on the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which we procured and receive all good things.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of <hi>Exhortation:</hi> Is <hi>Jehovah</hi> become <hi>our Righteouſneſs?</hi> O! admire Grace in it, and bleſs God and <hi>Chriſt</hi> for it, that you have ſuch a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to Build on; ſuch a Sacrifice to Feed on; ſuch a Pretious Remedy to be Healed by; ſuch an Excellent Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Waſh in; the Clefts of ſuch a Rock to dwell in. Our Juſtification ſeemed impracticable, yea impoſſible; we could not raiſe up our low Valley, or fill up the wide Breach that our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities had made; we had not wrought that Righteouſneſs, or performed that obedience that the Law requires: We could neither make a Preſent to God's Holineſs, or pay a Ranſom to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; yet God compares the Rejection of his People, to that which is to us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:41823:187"/>If Heaven above can be meaſured, and the foundations of the Earth be ſearched out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, I will alſo caſt off the Seed of Iſrael for all that they have done, ſaith the Lord.</hi> O! how wonderful is this? that when the Reception of Sinners might have been compared to things impoſſible, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is compared with things impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us. Hath God covered us with the Robe of Righteouſneſs? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. This ſhould be a garment of Praiſe: when we put it on, we ſhould break out into the ſweeteſt Songs, and higheſt Praiſes of God and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Meditate ſeriouſly on theſe following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We live in the laſt days of the World, and in the beſt days of the Goſpel. And this is the very ſeaſon, and time, when this Scripture ſhould be moſt eminently fulfilled, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſhould be called <hi>our Righteouſneſs.</hi> The excellency of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Obedience, and the efficacy of his Sacrifice is now ſignally manifeſted. This Name of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is now moſt eminently known, his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Titles and ſtyle Blazon'd; we are plainly told that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath condemned Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and that God Juſtifies the ungodly, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> Died for
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:41823:188"/>them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. Not only Sins are blotted out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.5. but Names are written in Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. Things were more dark in the times of the Law, though God promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins; yet there was a daily remembrance of Sin in the Sacrifices Offered up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.3. The day of the Law was God's forbearing time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. but the day of the Goſpel was <hi>Chriſt'</hi> bearing time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who himſel bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſo bear them, that he did bear them away. He died for our Sins and he Roſe again for our Juſtification <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> he purged and put away Sin <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>Heb</hi> 9.26. Though God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Old to be the God of his people <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. yet the Vail ſtood up in the times of the Law, as if Men ſhould be ſhut out from Heaven, from God and his Glorious preſence, but the Vail is now Rent, and the way laid open to the Heavenly Sanctuary, therefore we have more matter of, and motives to Praiſe, than the Church of God had of Old.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we are Juſtified freely by God's Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 24. O! what a wonder is this that we that were called Tranſgreſſors from the Womb, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.8.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:41823:188"/>ſhould call <hi>Jehovah our Righteouſneſs</hi> to Eternity; That we that have not wrought Righteouſneſs, yet ſhould be made the Righteouſneſs of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. That we ſhould be Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the Law! <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. That our Sins, that are our own, ſhould not be imputed, but that the Righteouſneſs, that is not our own ſhould be imputed. We have peace with God, not becauſe we have committed no Treſpaſſes, but becauſe they are not imputed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. There is much in our Hearts and Lives, that is Odious and Abominable before God, only it is hid and covered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. We have contracted a vaſt debt, but it is remitted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 2 We have committed Heinous Crimes, but they are not charged on us. There is that dwelling in us, and done by us, that exceedingly diſpleaſes God's eye and provokes his anger; but this is not remembred againſt us, or put to our account. The Law imputes nothing to us, but what is our own, is inherent in us, or done by us; but here is the Righteouſneſs of another given, and therefore imputed to us: it doth not grow in us, or ſpring out of us, but is rained on us. As God commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:41823:189"/>his Goodneſs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he brought them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> to poſſeſs <hi>Houſes they never built, Vineyards they never planted, Wells they never digged,</hi> Dout. 6.11.12. So God commends his Grace to us, that he gives us a Righteouſneſs that we never wrought our ſelves: <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that did not follow after Righteouſneſs, yet attained to Righteouſneſs by Faith,</hi> Rom. 9.30. O what aſtoniſhing Grace is this, That we that have not run the race of Obedience, ſhould yet win, and attain the prize of Righteouſneſs! Though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was an <hi>Idolater, Joſh.</hi> 24.2. yet he is ſtyled Righteouſneſs in the abſtract, by reaſon of his Juſtification; who hath called Righteouſneſs (ſo it is in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>) from the <hi>Eaſt, Iſa.</hi> 41.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That yet it ſhould coſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo dear to be <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs:</hi> How greately did the Soul of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Travel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. that our pardon and peace might be born? As he was God, he ſuffered much in our commiſſion of Sin; he was greived, wearied, vexed, preſſed under our Iniquities, as <hi>a Cart is preſſed under the ſheaves,</hi> Amos 2.13. and that, after this, he ſhould ſuffer ſo much more for the Expiation of them; <hi>He was wounded, pierced, bruiſed,</hi> Iſa. 53.10.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:41823:189"/>O how wonderful is this, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo freely, and without our ſollicitation, did ſo readily undertake to be a Surety! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8. <hi>Lo I come! I delight to do thy will, O my God!</hi> yet this was the will of God, that the Body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. yea, the Soul of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould be Offered up, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. God himſelf ſeems to ſpeak of this undertaking of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with Admiration. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Who is this that ingageth his Heart to approach to me?</hi> It was no ſmall matter to approach to God as Prieſt, and to be a Sacrifice, to draw near to God that was a Jealous God, and Furious, as it is expreſſed, <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.2. To approach to God, ſitting on a Fiery Throne, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Flaming Sword, Cloathed with the Garments of Vengeance: If <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Love had not been Fervent, and his purpoſes fixed, he would never have engaged his Heart to draw near to a God ſo terrible, and to undertake ſo hard a ſervice, to make Reconciliation with an angry, and to make reſtitution to a wronged God. O how amazing is this Fruit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s undertaking, that we may draw nigh to God, that is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Fire, and yet not to be hurt, but be refined by him! This was a great
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41823:190"/>Miracle that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s three Companions walked in the midſt of the Fiery Furnace, and yet had no hurt, but good; for their Bonds were broken, or conſumed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.23.25. And is it not as great a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Grace, that Believers walk with God, that is a conſuming Fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>laſt.</hi> and yet have no hurt, but good? God is for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31. How low did <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſtoop, that he might be <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs?</hi> He thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents his own Sufferings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.14. <hi>I am poured out like water;</hi> this ſeems to point at his Bloody Sweat on the ground; <hi>All my bones are out of Joint:</hi> This did intimate, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body was ſo ſtretched out; and extended on the Croſs, that all his bones were put out of Joint. He further complains, that his Heart was melted as wax within him; and this was by the ſence he had of the Heat, and Fire of Gods Wrath. The <hi>Manna</hi> which came down from Heaven was ground in a Mill, or beaten in a Mortar, and then baked in a pan to be Food for the <hi>Iſraelites, Numb.</hi> 11.8. So <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was <hi>Bruiſed,</hi> Iſa. 53.10. as <hi>Manna,</hi> in the Mill, or Mortar; yea, this Lamb of God was roſted in the Fire of his Father's Wrath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8, 9.
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:41823:190"/>The Sacrifices of the Law were not only killed, but burnt afterwards; which was a kind of ſecond death to them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.13. yea, there were <hi>whole burnt Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> Pſal. 51.19. and this whole Burnt-Offering did ſignifie not only that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body was wounded; but his Soul did ſuffer, and <hi>was made an Offering for Sin,</hi> Iſa. 53.10. The ſenſe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> had of his Fathers diſpleaſure; and forſaking of him, was a kind of ſecond death to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As <hi>Adam</hi> was a Criminal, caſt out of paradice; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> was as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner led out of the Garden to ſuffer Death; He became a Servant, that he might Juſtifie us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. O how would this affect our Souls, that where we deſerved all the Creatures ſhould be withdrawn, and ſhould ſerve us no more, as God threatens! <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. That when the Lord of Glory ſhould take on him the form of a ſervant, 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 6.7, 8. we deſerved that the Flower, and the Wine-preſs would feed us no more, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.2. yet that then the Son of God ſhould come down from Heaven to feed us with his Fleſh, and chear us with his Blood, <hi>John</hi> 6.53, 54, 55.57. Fleſh is weak, and becauſe of this, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be Crucified through weakneſs,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41823:191"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. yet this Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſet forth by bread that ſtrengthens Man's Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Blood is figured by Wine in his <hi>laſt Supper.</hi> Though the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſhed with unexpreſſible Anguiſh and Pain, yet this is ſet forth by Wine that chears Man's Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. Our ſtrength comes out of the weakneſs, our comfort comes out of the Sorrow of <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>true Rock</hi> ſmitten by the Rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Curſe of the Law: As that Rock being ſmitten did cleave, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> being ſmitten with the Curſe, his Soul and Body did part, that water of Life might flow forth to us, and that we might enter in, and dwell ſafely in him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>O my Dove, that art in the clefts of the Rock.</hi> We had vaſtly run in debt with God, and that God ſhould pay himſelf out of the Sufferings and Blood of his Son: We had proudly exalted our ſelves againſt God, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould debaſe himſelf ſo low to ſatisfie for our pride; and that his Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial ſhould make a Recompence to God for our Self-ſeeking. We diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured God, Reproached, Blaſphemed him, as a poor portion, as a hard Maſter, as a Righteous Law-giver: And how
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:41823:191"/>wonderful is, that the Reproaches, wherewith we Reproached God, ſhould fall on <hi>Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 15.3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though we are Juſtified ſo Freely, yet ſo Righteouſly. The Mercy-ſeat that covers the Curſe of the Law, is ſprinkled with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Blood, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.13, 14. <hi>We are Juſtified through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3.24. The priſon is opened to them that were bound, becauſe the Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is given as a Ranſom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Chriſt</hi> died as a Teſtator, that we might not be executed as Criminals, and Malefactors. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> became a Teſtator, he ſtript himſelf (as it were) of all good, Peace, Liberty, and expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all Evil, to Sufferings, Pain, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and Death it ſelf, and all this was to enrich us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. and that all good things might come to us in a Righteous way, that all Bleſſings might Swim to us in the Blood of our Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have had nothing to give to us, if he had not bought off our Tranſgreſſions from us, and purchaſed all good for us. As <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up his Rod over it, and the Red Sea was divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.16.21. So we may by Faith lift up the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> over the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:41823:192"/>deep Sea of the Wrath of God, and it will divide, and give us paſſage to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> Grace ſhall Reign through <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs to Eternal Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. What Praiſe doth this call for, that God and <hi>Chriſt</hi> do ſo often call us, and ſo earneſtly invite us to come into this Righteouſneſs of the Son of God? <hi>Come to me all ye that Labour, and are heavy Laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> Matth. 11.28. <hi>Look unto me, all the ends of the Earth, and be ſaved,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us, that, <hi>This is the Work of God, that you Believe on him whom he hath ſent,</hi> John 6.29. This is the great Work that God requires, and is beſt pleaſed with. It is a pleaſure to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſee his Seed, and to behold the Travel of his Soul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.11. This ſatisfies <hi>Chriſt</hi> when he ſeeth Souls Feed on the Bread that he gives, to waſh in the Fountain he hath opened, and to uſe Remedies he hath provided, and to put on the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Righteouſneſs he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. He hungers after the Juſtification, and Salvation of Men; and he is ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when Sinners truſt on him for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and look to him for Salvation. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth thruſt forth Labourers
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:41823:192"/>into his Harveſt to reap periſhing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though they are under many fears, difficulties, dangers, diſcouragments, yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> thruſts them out into his Harveſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>laſt.</hi> And then doth charge his ſervants by their earneſt importunity to compel gueſts to come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. God's pleaſure hath been fulfilled in Bruiſing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and now it is God's pleaſure that Men ſhould liſten to, and obey his call, and run to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O that it ſhould be the pleaſure of God to Bruiſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to Heal us, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to Juſtifie us! O that it ſhould be the pleaſure of the Lord to exerciſe Severity on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Mercy to us. <hi>Chriſt</hi> charges his Servants, by their earneſt importunity, to compel Gueſts to come into his Feaſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. Famiſhing Sinners do not feel their wants, and they do not preſs into <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Houſe: but the Servants are commanded by urgent and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Solicitations, to compel them. <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have his Houſe filled with Gueſts, and his Proviſions eaten by them; <hi>Chriſt</hi> counts it an Honour to him when we come to feed at his Table, and Feaſt on his Righteouſneſs, then his Name is Glorified in us, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11, 12.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:41823:193"/>
                  <p n="6">6. What Grace is this, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould not only prepare, and bring Righteouſneſs, but alſo apply it; as Parents provide Clothes for their little Children, and alſo put them on. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is God's Righteous Servant, that Juſtifieth many, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs Merits the very Faith that applyes it; that ſenſe ſeems to be offered by <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, as they ly in our Tranſlation, <hi>We obtain pretious faith through the Righteouſneſs of God, even our Saviour Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. this procures the Spirit to plant and work Faith. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> by his Spirit, draws us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 12.32. he not only opens the Fountain, but alſo waſhes Souls in it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5. he not only provided the Medicine, but alſo dreſſes the Wound, and binds up the broken in heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. <hi>Chriſt</hi> preſents his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Sufferings continually before God, which is his Burning Incenſe in the Heavenly Sanctuary, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. his Blood ſpeaks in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. and by the Spirit (as the Finger of our Great High-Prieſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.14.) it is continually, without intermiſſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſes, ſprinkled on the Conſciences of Believers on Earth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25.</p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:41823:193"/>
                  <p n="7">7.

That there is not only Peace, but <hi>Good-will,</hi> Luke 2.14. not only Enmity is quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but Love burns. Sin's place, and the Believing Sinner's too is changed.

This is matter of Praiſe, that there are ſuch admirable effects, or conſequences of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being made <hi>the Lord our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 1. That though the Curſe do fall on the Creatures for our ſakes, yet it falls not on thoſe that are Juſtified. When God made a Promiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> he does not ſay, Curſed art thou; but <hi>Curſed is the Ground for thy ſake,</hi> Gen. 3.15.17. God ſpeaks to <hi>Cain</hi> (a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate) in other Language; <hi>Now thou art Curſed,</hi> Gen. 4.11. God may Curſe the Creatures for our Sin, yet the Curſe may not light on our perſons and Souls. 2. That we are not only pardoned for the preſent, but ſecured for the future; God did not only preſerve <hi>Noah</hi> from being drowned by the Flood, but doth aſſure
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:41823:194"/>him that his Sins and the World's, ſhould not provoke him to ſend a Second Flood on the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.10.21. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.11. So here, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtands in the breach, to keep out an Inundation, and Flood of Venegance, and appears at the Bar to prevent the going forth of a Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence: As God doth ſee his Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow in the Clouds, and looks on it, and remembers his Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.13, 14, 15. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Rain-bow round about the Throne, to ſecure us from future ſtorms, and Floods of Evils. That God doth not only hide his Face from our Sins, but alſo blot out our Iniquities; that they may not, cannot be ſeen, or read for the time to come, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.9. 3. That not only God pronounces a Juſtifying Sentence in the Court of Heaven; but the Spirit alſo pronounces this Sentence in the Court of Conſcience: Cauſing the penitent Believer to hear the voice of Joy and Gladneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. and ſheds abroad the Love of God in the Heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. and ſeals him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of Redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. 4. As <hi>Jeſus</hi> did Engage his Heart to come nigh to God as a Surety, and Prieſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. ſo he now came, and doth bring us near to God, as Freinds,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:41823:194"/>Supplicants and Worſhippers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.5. That there is not only Peace; but alſo <hi>Good-will,</hi> Luke the 14. There is Grace to Eſtabliſh our Hearts againſt the dread of Vengeance, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Eternal Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. It is ſweet when no ſtorm of Vengeance hovers and hangs over the Sinners Head; no matter of Accuſation ſprings up in his Heart, to make him a burden to himſelf, and a terrour to others; O what ſore Temptations are guilty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in the anguiſh of their minds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to! Sometimes they could wiſh there were no God; or deſire themſelves rather to be annilalated, then to ſee his frowning Face, and feel his puniſhing Hand to Eternity: But the Grace of God guards, and Eſtabliſhes the Heart againſt ſuch dreadful wiſhes as theſe.</p>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſs may be compared to Flax, this is near to, and dwells in the Soul: Imputed Righteouſneſs may be compared to Wool, as it is a warm upper-Garment.

That you (as <hi>Noah</hi>) and his Family, ſhould be born up, and carried above the Waters, when others, like the Men of the Old World, do ſink into the deep, and Bottomleſs Sea of the Wrath of God.

                  <p>EVery awakened humble Soul ſhould with the <hi>Publican,</hi> cry earneſtly, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> Without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don God's Armoury cannot be ſhut, or his Treaſury opened. God cannot take us for his Inheritance, <hi>Exod. 34 9.</hi> Times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment cannot come to us from the preſence of the Lord, if our ſins are not blotted out, <hi>Acts 3.19.</hi> If our Conſciences are not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from dead works with the clean water of Chriſt's Blood, we cannot now walk in peace, go out of the world with comfort, enter into the heavenly Sanctuary with confidence. How therefore ſhould pardoning mercy endear God to us, ond engage us to God? We are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally without ſtrength to help our ſelves, and are alſo ungodly and ſo provoke God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and deny his help to us. We had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed God, and an Arreſt ſhould have followed,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:41823:200"/>and an Execution have taken hold of us. It is God's Right and Royal Prerogative, That his Will ſhould be our Supream Law, and his Glory our laſt End; but how have we debaſed God to exalt our ſelves? how have we as it were ſpoiled him of his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and juſtled him out of his Throne to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh our wicked wills, and obtain an abſolute, unlimited and an independent liberty. But Jeſus Chriſt died to make ſatisfaction for the wrong Man had done God, <hi>Pſal. 69.4.</hi> Then reſtored I that which I took not away. The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> affected to be as God in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Independency; the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> was condemned for ſaying he was the Son of God, <hi>Mat. 27.64, 65, 66.</hi> and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equal with God, <hi>John 5.18. John 10.36.</hi> So Chriſt paid the Debt he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and pacified the Wrath be did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke. And how much ſhould pardoning mercy engage our hearts to God? The beſt of men are but reconciled Enemies, releaſed Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, pardoned Malefactors. What mercy is it that he who ſeeth our ſins with indignation, ſhould yet himſelf cover them in mercy, <hi>Jer. 13. laſt. Pſal. 85.2.</hi> That the God that wrote down ſin, <hi>Iſa. 65.6.</hi> ſhould himſelf blot it out, <hi>Iſa. 43.25.</hi> Sin is a terrible writing it ſelf, and it draws after it another more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful writing, <hi>Job 13.25.</hi> Thou writeſt bitter
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:41823:200"/>things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the ſins of my Youth. The Sentence of Death did uſe to be written, and then read to Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals. Sin recorded will procure a written Sentence of Condemnation. Puniſhment is the Eccho of ſin. In this ſenſe <hi>Sanctius</hi> takes the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, <hi>Iſa. 59.12.</hi> Our ſins an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to us. How bad will it be to poſſeſs the ſins of Youth? The word rendred Youth, <hi>Job 29.4.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifies alſo Reproach. It is too often that Youth is perverted ſo that it is a Reproach to God and to us too. How neceſſary therefore is a Pardon to croſs God's Book, cancel our Bond, and reverſe the Sentence of Death? God that wounds us with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his Law, heals us by the ſtripes of Chriſt. He received Wounds that God might be Juſt in juſtifying them that believe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Rom. 3.25, 26.</hi> How gracious is God that at once removes from us the Incentives of Wrath, and preſents to us the Fuel of Love, <hi>Luke 7.47, 48.</hi> How precious ſhould Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be to us, that hath a ſweet retroſpect to Election, and as accompanied with, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable proſpect of Glory; Whom God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated and called, them he juſtified. Thus we may with admiration look back; And whom God juſtifies, them he glorifies, <hi>Rom. 8.30.</hi> And ſo we may with Joy look forward: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſprings from everlaſting Love; flows to,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:41823:201"/>and iſſues in eternal Life. What Thankfulneſs therefore doth it call for? If he juſtifies, we are no more to fear Crimes paſt, ſo they are no more to go on in ſin for time to come. Hath not Chriſt born ſufferings enough on the Croſs, that men will load him with new Affrints and Provocations? Thoſe do not think Chriſt's Sufferings to be bitter and heavy, that can make light of, and take delight in ſin. The Heart is to be Chriſt's habitation, <hi>Eph. 3.17.</hi> and not the receptacle of any ſweet and ſecret Luſt. We that daily need mercy, ſhould not daily provoke anger. As the work of Creation is attended with providence, which is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Creation, ſo the new pardon we need, and God beſtows, is a continual Juſtification; as the Creation would ſink without a day by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to uphold it, ſo Juſtification would ceaſe without a daily pardon to continue it. There may be a Pardon before a Trial, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Condemnation, as well as a pardon after Sentence to hinder Execution. That the Blood of Chriſt, which meritoriouſly purged ſin on the Croſs, <hi>Heb. 1.3.</hi> may be applied to you, and ſprinkled on you, to purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the Living God, is the unfeigned and ſervent deſire of,</p>

                  <p>IN the Text we have the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for Pardon; but it may be objected, 1. <hi>What need had</hi> David <hi>to beg Pardon; had not God given it already? Nathan</hi> told <hi>David, the Lord had put away his iniquity,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. I anſwer, Though God had pronounced the Sentence of Juſtification by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet it ſeems not to be pronounced in, and ſealed to <hi>David</hi>'s Conſcrence by the Spirits. Peace is the Fruit of the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:41823:202"/>Lips, as ſpoken by God's Miniſters, yet it is the Effect of the Spirit, as created in the Soul by it, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.19. The Prieſt did uſe to ſprinkle the Leper, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.7. But though <hi>David</hi> looked on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Spiritual Leper, yet he was not ſatisfied with the Prieſt's ſprikling him with the Blood of the Sacrifice; but he ſues to God himſelf to ſprinkle him with the Blood of his Son, the thing ſignified; ſo it is not enough for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in God's Name to pronounce Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but the Spirit muſt Ratify it, and Eſtabliſh Peace in the Soul, elſe the ſtorm will not ceaſe, the wound be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the burden be removed, and the Soul land at the Port of Aſſurance. The <hi>Pſaimiſt</hi> in the Text doth in an humble way Addreſs to God, <hi>That he would hide his Face from his Sins, and blot out his Iniquities;</hi> he doth imply, that if God's Eye was fixed on his Sins, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might be fired by them; there was Fuel for God's wrath, if God would but behold it; there was matter enough for Accuſation, cauſe enough for Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if God would but read it; but he begs God would turn away his Face, and ſhut his Eyes, not obſerving, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting what would be deſtructive to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:41823:202"/>him; the latter expreſſion in the Text enlarges and encreaſes the Senſe, and heightens the Mercy; he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pray that God would hide his Face from his Sins, but that he would blot out all his iniquities: A Man may turn away his Face from an Object, and yet the thing ſtill remain as it was, and be as viſible, as legible as before; but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſues to God, not only to hide his Face from ſeeing ſin, but that he would ſo blot it out, that it may not any more be viſible, legible, or remain to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Awakened humbled Souls do cry for this, as the moſt valuable Mercy, that God would hide his Face from their Sins, and blot out all their iniquities: But what is it for God to hide his Face from Sin? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is not to ſee and obſerve it with the Eye of Vindictive Juſtice. So it is ſaid, <hi>God doth not behold Iniquity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor ſee Perverſeneſs in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21.

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> God could not hide his Face from our Sins, if there were not a moſt pleaſant, grateful, lovely Object provided, towards which he might turn his Face, and on which he might fix his Eye on <hi>Mountebul,</hi> where the Curiſes of the Law were pronounced; there the Law was written on Stones, Plaiſtered
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:41823:203"/>over, and there an Altar was Built, and Burnt-Offerings preſented to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.2, 35.6. and we have the Truth of both in Chriſt, the Law is written in his Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>and he gave himſelf an Offering, a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. and this Sacrifice did ſmell the ſweeteſt in God's Noſtrils, becauſe it was bound only with Cords of Love, and burnt in Flames of Love. Jeſus Chriſt is the True High-Prieſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.36, 38. that was perfectly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, purely and abſolutely devoted to God. Holineſs to the Lord was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on Chriſt's Heart, and was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on all his Actions, impreſſed on his whole Life; and when he died for our ſins, he roſe again for our Juſtification, and aſcended up to Heaven, and appears in the glorious preſence of God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23, 24.

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:41823:204"/>with ſomewhat, that they might not be ſeen; and what could this be but the Righteouſneſs of our Mediator. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity muſt be blotted out with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and what is that but the Blood of our Surety and Sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But why is it ſo deſirable and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable a mercy for God to hide his Face from our ſins, and to blot out our iniquities?</hi> I ſhall anſwer to each of theſe diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is moſt deſirable that God would hide his Face from our ſins: For, Firſt, It is a moſt dreadful Evil for God to ſet our ſins before him; for them to be remembred by him, and to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually before him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 109.14, 15. This is there mentioned as the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Imprecation: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſadly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains thus, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90.8. <hi>Thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee: our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance.</hi> It is ſweet for Souls to walk in the Light of God's countenance, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.15. but it is dreadful for ſin to be ſet in the Light of God's countenance: for God to uſe and exerciſe his Omniſciency, to view ſin well, to countemplate to the utmoſt the Evil, the Filth, the Deformity that is
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:41823:204"/>in it, and all the Aggravations of it, and to ſet all in a full, clear and perfect Light. Here are Two Expreſſions, our ſins, and our ſecret. There is no more in the Original, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but our ſecret. <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> in <hi>Exam. Concil. Trident. cap. de pec. Orig.</hi> doth by, <hi>our ſecret,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Original Sin. Though the Fruits of it are Evident and Notorious to the World, yet the Root is ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to moſt in the World. One <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> that lived in <hi>London,</hi> and was for Murder Condemned to Death, being diſcourſed with in <hi>Newgate</hi> by Alderman <hi>Titchborn,</hi> did ingenuouſly confeſs he was an utter ſtranger to Original Sin; he knew nothing of it till he was by the Alderman inſtructed about it. Taking the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this ſenſe, this Interpretation is to be given, That God took a full View both of Original and Actual Sin; of the Root, and its Fruits; of the Fountain, and all its Streams; of the evil Treaſure that is in the Heart, and all the Corrupt Thoughts, Words and Actions, that were as Pieces Coined out of it: God obſerves alſo the actual Sins that are Secret to, and hid from Men; that are either wholly concealed, or palliated, and flouriſhed, and painted
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:41823:205"/>over with ſpecious excuſes and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.7. Tho there be a Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tomb of Profeſſions above, yet he ſeeth the corrupt rotten Heart that is underneath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. Yea; God ſeeth which way the Heart doth hang and ſway before ſin is actually conceived and brought forth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.21. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>their imagination, which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the Land;</hi> God did know the Bent, the Bias, the Propenſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Hearts toward Idolatry, before he brought them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> he knew what they would be, and do: This God did ſet in the light of his Countenance. Now it is Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible for God thus to ſet ſin before him.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. Sins thus ſet before his Face, do provoke him to turn away, and hide his gratious Countenance from Sinners, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.18. <hi>I will ſurely hide my Face in that Day, for all the Evils they have wrought.</hi> He doth threaten the ſame, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.20. If God doth but turn away his Face, Enemies will break in upon us, and Evils will over-whelm us, <hi>Ezel.</hi> 7.22. Yea, by our Sins, we deſerve for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to be caſt away from God's Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Glorious Preſence. <hi>Caſt me not
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:41823:205"/>away from thy Preſence,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin ſet before God's Face, doth provoke God's Anger againſt the Soul; it kindles Diſpleaſure againſt the ſin, and it ſtirs up God to pour it out on the ſinner, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.18. <hi>My Fury came up into my Face.</hi> Fury may be kept ſecret ſome time in God's Heart, but it will come up into his Face, and be openly manifeſted and expreſſed by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted by his hand.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God will ſet his Eyes on ſinners for Evil, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.8. <hi>Behold the Eyes of the Lord are on the ſinful Kingdom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it from off the Earth,</hi> Pſalm 34.16. <hi>The Face of the Lord is againſt them that do Evil, to cut off the Remembrance of them from off the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God will remove ſinners out of his ſight, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Caſt them out of my ſight,</hi> Jer. 23.39. <hi>I will caſt you out of my preſence,</hi> 2 Kings 17.23. The Lord removed <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of his ſight, and caſt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo out of his preſence, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.20. And God removed <hi>Judah</hi> out of his ſight, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.3. becauſe the King and the People did evil in his ſight, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.9, 19. They were not caſt out of the ſight of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:41823:206"/>God's Omniſcient Eye, but from the Eye of his gracious and Fatherly Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God will at laſt Rain a Hell from his Angry Face, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Thoſe that known not God, and obey not the Goſpel, ſhall be Puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <p n="2">2. If God hide his Face from our Sins, Love will come up into his Face, and look out at his Eyes on Believers, and Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy Countenance on us;</hi> the Love that was ſecret, and hidden in the Heart, comes up into his Face, and is manifeſted to, and ſhed abroad in the Hearts of Believers by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.10. I found Favour in his Eyes, Love and Kindneſs ſparkles in, and looks out from the Eyes, God looks with a pleaſing Countenance on his People; the Spiritual Day doth break and Dawn, and the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs doth Ariſe, and Shine in the Hearts of Believers, <hi>Malachy</hi> 4.2.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:41823:206"/>
                     <hi>Pſa.</hi> 130.5, 6. and the Countenance of God is ſaid to behold the upright, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>laſt.</hi> that is, with complacency and delight; he withdraweth not his Eyes from the Righteous, <hi>Job</hi> 36.7. He ſets his Eyes on them for good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.6. <hi>I will ſet mine Eyes on them for good.</hi> If Sin be not ſet before God's Face, God may take good out of his Treaſury for us, and beſtow it on us, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. yea, God will ſet us before his Face for Ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.12. <hi>That we may ſtill dwell in his Preſence,</hi> Pſal. 140. <hi>laſt. and behold his Face in Righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 17. <hi>laſt.</hi> Pſal. 16. <hi>laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is moſt deſirable for God to blot out all our Iniquities; for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the moſt dreadful Evil and Curſe that can be wiſhed, for Sin not to be bloted out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.14. <hi>Let not the Iniquity of his Mother be blotted out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If God do not blot out Iniquitie, he may by ſudden Judgement, and ſore Vengeance, blot perſons out of the Land of the Living, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Every

                     </gap>, <hi>I will blot out.</hi> Corrupt Men are Evil lines of being, and it is ſaid, <hi>It repented God that he had made Man on the Earth, it greived him at his Heart,</hi> Gen. 6.5. Man is ſo croſs, and contrary to the very end of his Creation, that God did blot out the Old World of Men by the Flood; if Men are bloted out of the World in their Sins, Where muſt they be lodged but in a miſerable Eternity?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we conſider what Sin is, What a valuable Mercy is it for it to be bloted out?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a miſt, a thinner, or a thicker Cloud, according to its Nature, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick Cloud thy Tranſgreſſions, and as a Cloud thy Sins.</hi> Sin is as a hiding Cloud, it hinders the light of God's Countenance from ſhining on us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your Sins have hid his Face from you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is as a ſtorming Cloud, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>The Lord will rain Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone on the Wicked, this ſhall be the portion
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:41823:207"/>of their cup.</hi> If Men ſuffer here, <hi>They are caſt into the hand of their Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Job. 8.4. In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>That God did caſt</hi> Job's Children <hi>into the hand of their Tranſgreſſion.</hi> If their Iniquities are puniſhed hereafter, they do for them fall into the hands of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin is a debt, Matth. 6.12. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our debts.</hi> Theſe debts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Creditor's Book. God ſaith, <hi>Behold it is written before me,</hi> Iſa. 65.6. and it is regiſtred alſo in the debter's Book, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. It is <hi>written,</hi> it is <hi>graven</hi> (that is <hi>the Sin of Judah</hi>) <hi>on the Table of their Heart.</hi> Sin is called a debt, becauſe the Sinner owes God Glory to be raiſed out of his Sufferings, and Eternal Torments. And it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable this debt ſhould be blotted out to prevent God's arreſt, and our Eternal Impriſonment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sin is a crime, a capital crime, and that which is kept ſafe as matter of accuſation againſt the Sinner. It is as it were <hi>ſowed up in a bag,</hi> Job 14.17. As the depoſitions of Witneſſes, and the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:41823:208"/>confeſſions of Malefactors are kept ſafe, againſt the Aſſizes and day of Trial. Yea, Mens Sins are ſealed up among God's Treaſures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34. God ſpeaks of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bitter and corrupt Fruit, and then puts this queſtion, <hi>Is not this laid up in ſtore with me? Is it not ſcaled up among my Treaſures.</hi> God hath a Treaſury of knowledg of all paſt things, and Sins are ſealed up among theſe Treaſures. But what a kind of capital crime is Sin? I anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is Rebellion againſt God. <hi>I have Nouriſhed, and brought up Children, and they have Rebelled againſt me.</hi> A Rebellious Subject with us, a Rebellious Son among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was put to Death: What Homage do we owe to God our King? What Obedience ſhould we render to God our Father?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin is Spiritual Whoredom and Adultery, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.12. <hi>They have gone a Whoring from under their God: Thou haſt deſtroyed ſuch as go a Whoring from thee,</hi> Pſal. 73.27. Adultery was capital, it was puniſhed with death by the Law of God; Men loath God, and love the Creature.</p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:41823:208"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Sin is Robbery and Stealing, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Ye have Robbed me.</hi> God ſaith, <hi>My Son give me thy Heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. But the Heart of Men goeth after their Coveteouſneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. Though they are by Baptiſm, and a Solemn Covenant, devoted to God, yet they Sacrilegiouſly alienate themſelves from God, Iſa 24.5. <hi>They broke the Everlaſting Covenant.</hi> Is it not our benefit to have our Crimes blotted out?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Sin be not blotted out, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not write his Laws in our Hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. God promiſeth <hi>to write his Laws in the Heart.</hi> And why? It is thus anſwered, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. <hi>For I will forgive their Iniquity, and I will Remember Sin no more.</hi> Forgiveneſs of Sin is the root of all the Promiſes, and Covenant-Bleſſings.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God cannot record any Good thoughts, words or works of ours, if Sin be not blotted out, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>A Book of Remembrance was written before him for thoſe that feared the Lord, and thought on his Name.</hi> Sin doth ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:41823:209"/>and ſtain our beſt Works, that, nothing might be recorded for our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or advantage. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prays, that <hi>God would not wipe out his good deeds,</hi> Neh. 13.14.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If Sins be not blotted out, the time is coming when God's Book will be opened, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12. God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view Men's Sins, look on them, and read them over to Sinners for ever. Yea Conſcience alſo will repeat them over, upbraid with them, Condemn, Laſh and Scourge for them to Eternity. <hi>This is the Worm that never dies,</hi> Mark 49.46, 48. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>That his Heart ſhould never Reproach him,</hi> Job 27.6. But the Hearts of Unpardoned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall ever Reproach them for their folly; Ingratitude, Perverſeneſs, and Obſtinacy againſt God, that they had <hi>a Heart of Stone</hi> that would not relent, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.

But the Wicked do harden themſelves in Sin, and quiet themſelves under guilt quite another way. He thus feeds his unbelief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.11. <hi>He hath ſaid in his Heart, God hath Forgotten: He hideth his Face, he will never ſee it,</hi> verſe 13. <hi>The Wicked contemn God: he hath ſaid in his Heart thou wilt not Require it.</hi> They think God lyes on a Couch of eaſe, not that he ſits on a Throne of Majeſty, and a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Juſtice: they fooliſhly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that God will not call for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from Men, or call for a Sword of Juſtice to awaken againſt them. They think there is no danger from God's Frowning Face: that no Storm is to be dreaded from his Angry Countenance: they account that God is not concerned about their Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:41823:210"/>that he diſlikes them as little as they, or forgets them as much as they, Faith Cures the Wound in Saints: but Unbelief Skins it over in the Wicked.</p>

As the Souls of Saints are hid in Heaven from eternal evils, ſo their Bodies are hid in the Grave from Temporal Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. The Grave, that is a Priſon to the Wicked, to reſerve them in for Eternal Vengeance, is to Believers a Hiding-place from Temporal Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. They ſhall ſee his Face in Glory, Revel. 22.4. <hi>They ſhall ſee his Face, and his Name ſhall be in their Forehead: As for me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) Pſal. 17. laſt. <hi>I will behold thy Face in Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have in theſe days of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel great Incouragements, ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to prefer this Petition. God did, for a time, cloud and hide his Face from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did cut him off, and <hi>blot him out of the Land of the Living,</hi> Pſal. 22.1. Iſa. 53.8. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> entred into deep waters, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.1, 2. the floods of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Reproach and Sufferings did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow him: and now we may cry to God out of our depths, Pſal. 130.1. <hi>Out of the depths have I cried to thee, O Lord, out of a depth of Guilt, Trouble and Anguiſh. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came into the Depths, and we may confidently cry to God to raiſe us out of our Depths. The Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as to Worth and Merits, is a deep Sea; and we may truſt on God, through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to drown our ſins in the depth of this Red-Sea, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. <hi>Thou wilt caſt-all their Sins into the depths of the Sea. Chriſt</hi> hath provided Spiritual Red-ink enough. Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhed
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:41823:214"/>his Blood but once, yet God may 1000 and 10000 times over dip his Pen in the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and blot out all our Sins we Commit. It was painful to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſhed his Blood, but it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to him to waſh Souls in it. A dark night came on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but we may wait for the dawning of a Comfortable and Joyful Morning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.5.6. The Righteouſneſs is brought by which we may be Juſtified, the Blood is ſhed in which we may be waſhed from all our Sins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. Men did hide their Faces from <hi>Chriſt</hi> under his Sufferings, as a ghaſtly ungrateful object, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.3. Being ſo Buffeted, Spit on, Crowned with Thorns, but we may lift up our Faces to him being now Juſtified by the Father, Seated in his Throne, and Crowned with Glory.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak ſomething by way of Direction, both how we may obtain the blotting out of our Sins, and how we ought to walk ſutable, and anſwerable to ſo great a Mercy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt ſee and know our Sins, be ſenſible of them, afflicted for them, burdened under them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. <hi>I
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:41823:214"/>acknowledge,</hi> or as others Render the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> word, <hi>I know my Iniquity,</hi> Iſa. 59.12. <hi>As for our Iniquities we know them.</hi> Why did the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſo earneſtly beg that God would <hi>blot out his Tranſgreſſions, and waſh him from his Iniquities?</hi> He renders this reaſon of his petition, <hi>I know my Tranſgreſſions,</hi> that is, how much they offend and provoke thee, and how much they defile and deform me. He, that is not burdened, will not cry to be eaſed: he, that is not wounded, will not ſue to be healed: he that beholds not his debt, will not preſs for the cancelling of his bond. And we muſt ſee Sin, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor and deteſt it, and forſake it: Shall we ſeek to God to put it away as Evil, and yet we harbour it in our Hearts, and indulge it in our practice, as good? It muſt be hid not only from the Eye of God's vindictive Juſtice, but alſo from the Luſtful Adulterous eye of our Souls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Believe on him, <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>He that ſeeth the Son and Believeth on him ſhall not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi> The Curſes of the Law are <hi>Amen</hi> to thoſe that are out of <hi>Chriſt, Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>laſt.</hi> But the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:41823:215"/>Promiſes of the Goſpel are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> to thoſe that are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not carried our Sins upon the Tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. we muſt have born them, and they would have ſunk us down into the Bottomleſs pit. Though God doth pardon, and put away Sin Judicially, as a King, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. yet it is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that puts it away Meritoriouſly as a Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. As you know your Iniquities, ſo, you muſt know <hi>Chriſt</hi> to take them away, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my Righteous ſervant Juſtifie many: for he ſhall bear their Iniquities:</hi> He did bear them for a time, that they might not be bound on us to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt earneſtly deſire God, not only to hide his face from our Sins, but alſo to turn our eyes from behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37. How ſweetly do theſe two petitions harmonize, and agree? <hi>Lord hide thy Face from my Sins, and turn away my eyes from beholding vanity. Lord ſheath thy Sword towards me, and lay thy ax to the root of in-dwelling Sin. Lord forgive all my wrong ſteps and wandrings, and Lord order my ſteps in
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:41823:215"/>thy word, and let no Iniquity have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over me,</hi> Pſal. 119.133. <hi>Lord blot my Sins out of thy Book, mortifie them in, and root them out of my Heart. I have wandred from thee, I have walked contrary to thee,</hi> too Long already, <hi>but now Lord quicken, and lead me in the way Everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 119.37. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Your Sins muſt ſtill be before you to humble you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. Though they are not before God's Face to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.14, 15. Though God will not Remember them, to throw you down to Hell for them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41.14. yet you muſt Remember them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. to caſt you down to the duſt for them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You muſt ſet no evil thing before you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.3. you muſt not delight in any Sin, or practiſe it. Shall God caſt Sin behind his back, and ſhall you ſet it before your Face?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You muſt ſtill Set the Statutes and Laws of God before you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.30. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth, thy
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:41823:216"/>Judgements have I ſet before me.</hi> As a Scholar ſets his Copy before him, orders his pen, and ſhapes his Letters by it, ſo we muſt eye the Rule, and govern our actions by the Law of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. <hi>Branch of the uſe of Exortatiom:</hi> Is the blotting out of Sin ſo valuable a Mercy? Is the hiding of God's Face from your Tranſgreſſions ſo deſirable a thing? O then be exceeding thankful for it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take away Iniquity, ſo will we render the calves of our lips. Aſcribe Glory to him that hath loved you, and waſhed you from your Sins in his own Blood,</hi> Revel. 1.5, 6. This is a Mercy that ſeems to work things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: it ſhuts the Mouth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>laſt.</hi> and yet it opens the Lips, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.15. it ſhuts the mouth from boaſting, or pleading our own works, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>laſt. That thou mayeſt Remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more: Becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done.</hi> But pardon opens the lips to praiſe God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14.15. <hi>Deliver me from Blood Guiltineſs, and my Tongue ſhall Sing aloud of thy Righteouſneſs, open
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:41823:216"/>thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi> Guilt ſeales up the lips, and deads the Heart, as to praiſing of God. The Gentiles were unthankful for all their common benefits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. but it was God's great deſign to bring them to Glorifie him for Reconciling, Juſtfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pardoning Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.9. that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may Glorifie God for his Mercy. O therefore Glorifie God for pardoning of you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Sin which was before God's Face, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.2. ſhould be caſt behind his back, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You have hid your Faces from God and his Laws, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. God charges the <hi>Iſarelites</hi> that they hid their eyes from his Sabbaths, turned to him the back and not the Face, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.35. that they caſt his word behind their back, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.17. and caſt himſelf behind their backs; And is not this a ſtrange return, a wonderful Retaliation, that God ſhould caſt the <hi>Sins of Tranſgreſſours behind his back?</hi> Iſa. 38.17.</p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:41823:217"/>
                  <p n="3">3. If God had not in Mercy hid his Face from your Sins, he would in Wrath have hid his Face from your Souls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.9. <hi>Hide not thy Face far from me, put not away thy ſervant in anger.</hi> This we deſerved if God not turned himſelf from his fierce anger, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 85.3. he might have been angry with us every day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11. we might have ſpent all our days in his Wrath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.9. yea, God might have been angry with us for ever, and drawn out his Wrath to all Eternity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.65. What Grace is this that God will not keep anger for ever? <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. but will keep Mercy for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.28.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If God's anger had not been turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.4. our Sins would have hid God's Face, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. and have turned away good things from us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.26.</p>
